# Q: What languages are most important to managers?

There are lots of ranked lists for programming languages out there. Most
of them are biased and no where near scientific. None of them actually
measure languages in production use since so much of that work is
guarded behind government and business walls. But there is one report
that might shed a little perspective in addition to the rest.

On page 11 & 12 of the "HackerRank 2020 Developer Skills Report" the
most important languages from a managers perspective are the following:

1. Javascript
1. Python
1. Java
1. C#
1. C++
1. PHP

That sounds about right for the global average. I happen to know that Go
should be in there (since all of cloud-native has been developed with
it) but it hasn't permeated the manager popularity barrier.

Thanks to lousenti for finding this.
