# Weird Broke-Ass Code at Work

Why the fuck would anyone ever have two shebang lines like this:

```
#! /bin/bash
#! /usr/bin/python
```

There are so many things wrong with that I grow tired of ranting about
them already:

* Why the fucking space after the shebang? I know you can, but don't.
* Why *two* shebang lines?
* Why no specific version of python?
* Why not `/usr/bin/env`? (even though there is one good reason not)
* And, how the fuck is this even working? (cuz it is)
* How much was the person being paid to created that shit?

Every once in a while we techs who work fucking hard to keep up and
learn new things get a nice, friendly reminder that not everyone shares
those values. This is one of those times.

Maybe someone will read this and realize the error of their ways. Maybe
not.
