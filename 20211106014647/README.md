# Sick of Music Issues with YouTube and Twitch

* Hour long video is demonetized by 15 second bit of music at end
* Have to clip it (in this case) but risk of having video blocked
* Is it even moral to stream copyright music that you have purchase?
* Problem is the definition of "broadcast"
* Creators do not make money off of their creations
* Rich production companies that get all of the money
* Use of copyright free content will *still* copyright strike you
* The "sharing economy" will eventually correct all of this
* We need to practice "civil disobedience"
* DCMA is evil and was created *not* for the creators
* None of this will withstand the new personal broadcasting world
* FCC has attempted to block personal broadcasting world
* Twitch will just mute the segments of "copyright" music 
* Twitch is *effectively* saying, "just to let it save anywhere" 
* What is the difference between playing music at a house party and Twitch?
* Are you breaking the "broadcast" law at Christmas?
* Explore saving only microphone to disk and adding to video for YouTube
* Twitch VODS still have value even if pushed to YouTube
* Twitch VODS pick up where left off, and have chat stored
* I will link YouTube videos to Twitch VODs
