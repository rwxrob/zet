# I Really Love All My Bonzai Favs Completing

There's something really fulfilling seeing my collection of Bonzai
composite commands displaying all neatly every time I type `z` and tab.
It's a great way to remember what I have to pick from. Such was *never*
the case with bash, which would show me everything on the fucking system
that matched. By having `z` just for my pet commands I can isolate all
my completion to it. In fact, this has really shaded my opinion of
multicall binaries in general. I really *like* the `z` separation. But
making them all multicall not only to I have to create all the links,
but then all my favorites get thrown into the host system pool of
completions with everything else. Here's the modern, objective truth:
monoliths fucking rock. We have memory now. We have static linking now.
We have cross-compilation for *any* architecture. Now is the time of the
monolith. Bonzai!!
