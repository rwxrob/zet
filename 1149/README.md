# Focusing on Ubuntu Server Over All Others

The more I evaluate the current state of Linux server distros --- by
actually trying them out in my home lab --- I cannot help but realize
how much better Ubuntu server really is than Red Hat. I really have a
hard time understanding why enterprise consistently *still* picks Red
Hat. Whatever the reason, it's not very well informed by practical
experience.

Red Hat fails on so many levels I would have to write a book about it,
essentially, Red Hat has IBM "sickness" overcomplicating things
unnecessarily and focusing on technologies that just don't matter, that
whole "you'll use what we give you" instead of actually listening to
users.

Canonical has made huge mistakes, but that company definitely listens
more to the industry users, enterprise and the rest. In fact, it has
been their mantra from the beginning, focused on usability at every
level. But here are the main reasons:

* Usability: there is no simpler way to install, to anything
* Relevance: Ubuntu Server has become the industry standard
* FOSS support: Ubuntu is Debian at the core
* Commonality: just `apt` everywhere
* Innovation: cloud-init, openstack, etc.
