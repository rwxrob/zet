# I Just Cannot Talk and Code

I'm having to own-up to an objective truth that I really hate: I simply
cannot produce good code and talk at the same time. I'm not talking
about talking through problematic algorithms, for that I will mumble to
myself even if no one is around. I'm talking about the really fast
typing and middle-focus stuff that just needs me to refactor code, or
document it. When I start blabbing I just lose the thought all the time.

Talking has its own advantages. I have discovered things while talking
and explaining that let to other things I wasn't expecting. I think that
is the value of having a community. But when it comes time to focus and
get code or written content done, not having to talk and respond really
goes a long way. I'm been more prolific in my code and work for the last
two weeks since I returned to just putting HackerYoga music on and
mostly ignoring the chat and doing my thing. I cannot stop. Not even if
it means some will unsub and be annoying by Twitches notifications that
I'm here when I'm actually not.
