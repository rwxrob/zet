# KEG Specification Conclusions

* CommonMark excels at outlining (over YAML)
* Focus on README.md as *the* main content
* Increase semantic meaning of README.md DOM
* Add `key = value` labels after `#tag` in final verbatim section
* Drop YAML and JSON from Knowledge Node spec
* (YAML and JSON files can obviously still be included)
* Just use CommonMark + GFM Tables + Math for everything
* Noted the similarity between ZK and KEG stuff
