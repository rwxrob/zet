# Derek Taylor's Job is Making YouTube Videos

Distrotube's life goal is to quit his job (in Social Media Marketing)
and make videos about Linux distributions and wacky politics.  And looks
like he's going to reach his goal, and that's fine, but *no one* should ever
listen to or trust anything this inexperience shill has to say about
*any* technology -- especially if when his only formal education is an
Associates in Social Media Marketing from LDS Business College.
It's completely obvious Derek's agenda is to shill to the most popular
topics and say whatever will get him the most views and those
sweet Patreon "Executive Producers". Every action in his public life has
confirmed this objective truth. Watch him if you want, but there are far
better ways to learn actual, relevant skills.

> Case you hadn't noticed, I am tired of pussy-footing around
this. Derek just happens to be one of my first targets. We have to call
this out before the 10s of thousands of people watching them are
ruined.

Almost ever video from DistroTube is full of completely irrelevant and
nonsensical bullshit that demonstrates a lack of basic technical skill,
fundamentals of the UNIX philosophy, basic critical thinking, and
frankly, just plain common sense. This is what I would expect
from someone who went to to LDS Business College for social media
marketing and has no actual technical experience to speak of.
(Disclaimer: I grew up almost literally down the street from that
college in West Valley City, Utah).

Why do people listen to this person?

Stop. Stop now, before he rots your brain with a marketing hyperbole,
inexperienced pseudo-techo babble, and bad practices. He's definitely
not worthy of the `cmatrix` he plays on screens in the background. He
openly admits to hating the terminal and preferring Emacs because, and I
quote, "It's a GUI application."

The fact is that Derek would never pass the first round of most
mid-level technical interviews for *any* modern technology job in the
field for which he professes expertise.

I guess what I'm saying is please find *anyone* else with more
experience to listen to and just stop wasting your time with this dude.

Let me be clear, while I do put my own content out there, and while I do
get paid for it by sponsors (thank you). I also have a full-time job and
30+ years developing software, doing systems operations, building Linux
systems for personal and professional engagements, and using Linux daily
(check my [CV] if you care). But it's not about me. It's about *anyone
with actual experience.* 

[CV]: <https://github.com/rwxrob/cv>

I've already said it, but I'm gonna say it again. *Please* find
*experienced* people to be your mentors, wherever they are. Look into
your own family and social circles, get a mentor from among those people
who actually work in the trade, *not* someone anxious to get *out of
technology* so he can make Linux "review" videos all day and make good
on his degree in social media marketing, someone who doesn't even
recognize how asinine the entire focus on Linux distributions in the
modern virtual and containerized world.

There. I've said my peace. Dems fighting words, I know. But I really
don't give a shit. They need to be said. I sincerely believe Derek to be
as good a person as one can be who got a Social Media Marketing degree
by choice (and remember, my first wife got an advertising degree, and
um, that didn't work out so well). Be authentic. Find authentic people.
That's the real message here.
