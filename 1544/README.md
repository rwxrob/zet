# Get Round Tortilla Chips to Save Mouth

I've eaten a lot of chips in my day, mostly because I deal with corn
more than most other grains (can't do wheat). And one thing that I've
noticed is that after woofing down a bunch of chips and tomatoes or
avocado or salsa I have gashes in my mouth. I know, I know. I should
slow down and enjoy my food. But usually when I finally do eat I'm so
hungry that I'm a fucking animal.

So here's the thing, eating chips like that with corners is brutal on
your mouth, but if you get round chips that don't have to be broken in
half to fit in your mouth, you achieve chip eating nirvana. Happy tummy.
Happy mouth.
