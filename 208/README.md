# Kubernetes Certifications, Which and Why?

Really the only certs that matter are those from Cloud Native
Foundation:

* Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)
* Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
* Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)

I have heard people say CKA is harder and should be first, and vice
versa. I'm getting CKAD because I lean toward applications development
more than operations and administration. (I'm about 70% dev and 30%
admin.)

I'm getting it because Kubernetes has many disparate parts and I want to
be sure I've covered everything with no gaps. The CNCF certs are also
done through interactive challenges instead of multiple choice. I also
want to be able to help others who want to go through the process, even
though not everyone might actually need to go through it.

Keep in mind, getting the certification is only the beginning of what
you will need to actually get a job doing it. I personally believe you
should regularly run and maintain a local Kubernetes cluster on hardware
in your home lab before really seeking employment.
