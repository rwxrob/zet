# Q: How do you fight burnout?

It's a battle between burnout and restlessness.

1.  Un-cage yourself, find a way not to feel trapped
2.  Get outside (or play Minecraft)
3.  Take a shower
4.  Move (yoga for me)
5.  Calm your mind
6.  Spend time doing stuff with family
7.  Time boxing
8.  Get a pet
9.  Sleep
