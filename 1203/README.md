# How do you get large color font title on terminal?

All the fonts that I use are in a separate repo. The figlet fonts I've
collected over the years are all under `figlet`. I just combine the
`figlet` and `lolcat` command to get the result you see in these
scripts. You can search my `scripts` directory for anything with these
commands to see how it works.

The main figlet font I use is `future`.
