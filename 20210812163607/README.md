EzMark is CommonMark + GFM tables with the following constraints making
it drop dead simple to learn and parse â€” even from shell scripts.

* Front-matter (YAML, etc.) has never been allowed in CommonMark
* Only one first level heading in the file
* First level heading *must* be on first line
* First level heading must only have a single space after `#`

* Use `*`,`**`,`***` only for italic, bold, bold italic
* Use `1.` only for ordered lists
* Only use a single space after list item marker
* Use `----` only for separator / horizontal rule
* All blocks *should* be wrapped to 72 columns
* Use `\`\`\`foo` fences only for code blocks
* Use `~~~foo` or `~~~~foo` only for code block contains conflicting
* Use plain `\`\`\`` as non-specific code block
* Use two or more trailing spaces for hard breaks
* Just links in link destinations (no hover text)
* Understand code blocks will be snipped when "codeless" applied
