# Planning IRL Streaming and Digital Nomad Life

1. First priority decisions:
    * Do you have roots? Family? Job?
    * How much can I pay additional per month?
    * How much time to stream do I have?
    * How much tolerance to I have for being public all the time?

1. Options:
    * GoPro to Twitch directly
    * StreamLabs on phone with overlays
    * Intermediate (home) server

1. Definitely going with SRT build / kit

1. Stages of trial and error:
    1. Just phone on walks (without video stabilization)
