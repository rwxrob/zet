# ZettelRepos Might Just Be Hacker's Best Friend

Hackers like it fast and compact. They often are racing against a clock
or a competitor. They fucking hate taking time to look stuff up and have
learned to get answers to their questions in the least amount of time
possible, which is why they love things like `lynx` and `curl` so much.

It's no surprise, then, that the ZettelRepo approach to knowledge
management falls directly in line with these hacker top priorities.
Zettels are the perfect size to capture a little trick, hack, vuln, or
reference. Being able to compose and tag and search them later is just a
bonus later. Then being able to share them anonymously anywhere, and
even follow them and keep synced up, is even better.

The rest of the world might need time to understand the value
ZettelRepos provide, but hackers everywhere just grok it immediately.
Which one are you?
