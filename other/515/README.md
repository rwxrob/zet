# Reference Link Markdown Better Than Speed

Going through the [wish list] and realized that I don't even want Ezmark
anymore. That is really sobering realization. Reference links are just
better since the priority is *still* on Markdown readability --- even
more so now that I'm using knowledge repos with nothing but `README.md`
in them these days. I've really gone all in on the GitHub thing, which
means using GFM. In fact, while I'm not against LaTeX and math notation
I personally almost never use it. There is nothing stopping anyone from
using it on GitHub, and rendered repos to `/doc` is still a very good
option for people who need that, I just don't (and probably never will).
I feel a little selfish not building things that others can use as well
as easily. But in this case I haven't *prevented* them from using it if
they decide to follow some part of my ZK knowledge repo method.
