# IRL Streaming Kit Conclusions

> ðŸ’¡
> Lock your phone in 4G! Disable Wifi and Bluetooth.

After more than three weeks researching IRL streaming approaches and
kits I've concluded on the following based on what I plan to do:

* Do most things from my desk, laptop, or lab table with fixed web cams
* Use Rode Go II wireless to go mobile (locally) in the room
* Get VXLR+ to plug Rode into my sound board (XLR) via Cloudlifter
* Use Google Pixel 6 + DJI OSMO 4/5 gimbals when remote
* DJI OSMO 5 has half battery of 4, but extends
* DJI OSMO 4 has 2400 battery that can even charge phone while on
* Having both 4 and 5 compliment each other and allow charging
* Use StreamLabs mobile for everything (1080 @ 30 fps, 2500 bitrate)
* Also use the Rode Go II wireless for wind and interviews
* Use a TRRS splitter on phone for mic and headphones
* Disable Wifi and Bluetooth completely on phone
* Lock phone to LTE 4G (no 5G, the switching kills stream)
* Get an ANKERS battery (mid size), plug gimbal and phone on breaks

For longer trips:

* Netgear Nighthawk 5G (locked in LTE 4G mode)
* Take old phone as backup (with Streamlabs installed)
* Bring one or more substantial batteries MAXOAK (large) when needed
* Bring laptop and stream from that when possible
* Sign up for norip.io (or comparable) service

All the shit people do with LiveU and Belabox is completely and totally
unnecessary. Hitch even said so with a bit of edge in his voice once
when asked saying, "The LiveU is just a big power drain." Most of
Hitch's streams are with a single Netgear Nighthawk 4G hotspot that is
"unteamed" with anything else and he pushes 1080 at 30 fps.

Watching Hitch has made me realize the single most annoying thing on the
road (besides finding a good signal) is battery life. Anything that
burns battery without being needed is a waste. In fact, there is a mount
for bicycle handlebars that holds the OSMO 4/5 so that you can read the
screen while still getting all the unparalleled stabilization without
lost of picture quality. All the digital stabilizers really slam image
quality, yes even the GoPro. Plus, disabling the stabilization makes
your compression faster on your phone (which is basically a wash when
you consider the battery feeding your gimbal). The important thing is
that your phone is worth far less. It doesn't have to superheat to find
a non-existent 5G signal before it bails. It doesn't have to talk to
anything on Bluetooth or wifi. All it has to do is capture and send the
video feed to Twitch. Simplifying everything makes batteries last longer
and everything consumes less bandwidth.

Looking back now I see how completely stupid the idea of using a GoPro
is. I would never have known that without going through all of this. The
ultimate test will come when I run the Turkey Trot with my OSMO 4
holding it to my chest. I already know people are using the OSMO for
cycling and the type of biking I would be doing falls within that
category.

In fact, the only thing I won't be able to do is use both my hands for
anything. I had planned on picking up garbage during my walks and that
could get hard, but I'm still going to try it, one arm will be using the
trash picker, the other holding the gimbal. I suppose that tanks my
wife's ideas for POV porn as well, damn. (We'll get over it.)

Strangely, just using a phone is actually totally fine for
paddle boarding provided I get a mount. The Pixel 6 is 100% waterproof
to something like three meters. I would not submerge it, but it is
apparently fine for splashes and stuff. If and when I do any really
serious water sports, I won't be streaming them. For that a GoPro makes
a lot of sense.

I did discover something else that I *really* want to include in my life
streaming activities: live music sessions. I'll be taking all that
obscene amount of money I would have spend on everything else and
getting a zoom to plugin to my mac or phone. I really want to live
capture great busking music when possible.
