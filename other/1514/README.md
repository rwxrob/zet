# Learn Web APIs Well, They are Everywhere

First of all, an "API" is much bigger than a "web API". But, these days
when someone says it they mean the web version (as much as that chaps my
ass). Anyway, you have to learn them. Whether you are a ops person
(consuming, debugging, and hacking them) or a
dev (creating them).

Good API design is something that takes years of experience. It's about
organization, business and systems and domain analysis, and all that
stuff that goes into good database design as well. But, you can't make
one without first learning to make a web server. These days the dominant
language for API creation is Go using nothing more than `net/http`. This
is because Go has the strongest standard library of any enterprise
computing language, compiles to a single FROM SCRATCH (Dockerfile term)
binary, and is highly concurrent and portable.

Here's a resource for getting started. I've not looked at it much, but
Twitch streamer het_tanis recommends.
