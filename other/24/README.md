# Global Shell Variables are Good for Learning

It occurred to me that POSIX shell just might be the simplest (if not
the weirdest) language to learn first. Obviously, global variables have
significant draw backs. But they are also so easy to learn when just
starting out. So long as the dangers of having no scope on *any*
variable is understood (perhaps by crashing those learning into a wall
where this is a very bad thing and learning from it) then they are not
only fine, but possibly preferable for beginners. It's definitely not a
popular opinion. But they are already using the shell language every
time they enter a command, so might as well built on that, *then* build
on that base into a structured language like C and/or Go. It really
makes the case to use a very strictly scoped language immediately after
shell to show the contrast. Once again, Python is horrible for beginners
because of this, as is JavaScript.
