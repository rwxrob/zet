# ðŸ“ž Which OS is better for programming?

Whatever one works for you. I run Ubuntu Server running in VMware on both Windows desktop, and Mac laptop. Personally, after running a Linux desktop for more than a decade I want nothing to do with Linux desktops. Most people cannot run Linux desktops at work, and I want to help *them*. Plus, OBS and gaming is better on Windows than Linux. Things like "noalbs" are Windows only (which is absolutely essential for the BelaBox IRL streaming I do). I also use Podman desktop just on a plain Mac as well.
