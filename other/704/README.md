# Lucifer Morningstar, a Satan I Could Have a Drink With

I'm a huge Lucifer fan. In this cheesy/fun television series Lucifer
Morningstar has the supernatural ability to look deeply into anyone's
eyes and ask, "What is it you desire?" Then he goes about facilitating
what it is they want. That's Satan's gig in this detective/sit-com,
drawing out people's desires, and then punishing them when they cross
the line. He doesn't *make* them do anything. He's there to help them
realize what they want and punish them when what they do is bad. That's
a Satan I could have a beer with.

By the way, hell is your own guilt and reliving what causes you to have
it over and over again.
