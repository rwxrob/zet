# Lessons Learned from First IRL Stream

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/J8EJNKe7Oa4>

* First video in a new playlist about live streaming tips and tricks
* Decided to get the GoPro 9 because 10 (does not have preview in app)
* Found out that Media Mod is *required* for lavalier mic
* Media Mod is *not* waterproof (but water resistant)
* Media Mod is a pain in the ass for changing batteries
* Media Mod USB-C is *only* for power
* I do like that the GoPro has a stereo mic
* Prefer a chest strap position (easier to cover up)
* Activate stealth mode to prevent unwanted attention
* I don't want to *have* to wear the same hat
* I'm not trying to hide, just be more discreet
* I'm never going to have enough battery with just phone and GoPro 
* Had to activate hotspot and "premium" for Verizon (\$10/month)
* Decided to record everything, potentially edit, and then upload to YouTube
* Reminder *never* to save VODS (no need to delete)
* Will be streaming RTMP to OBS when on local wifi
