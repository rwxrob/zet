# Personal Bonzai Utility Monolith (z)

I've been really enjoying moving to a single binary (`z`) for all my
favorite command line utility needs. It blows me away how easy it is to
add a new subcommand with Bonzai. It's everything that I always dreamed
it would be. I still need to get the `help` working with BonzaiMark and
eventually will add multicall binary support, but as it is right now is
already fucking amazing. The first time I build in someone else's cool
subcommand I'm going to just die. The potential here is exponential;
everyone creating amazing little utilities for things that they really
need, and then just building pulling them in. Even if things get out of
control and we are putting all of Vim or `kubectl` or something like it
we are talking not more than a few megabytes total for the
application. It's like all the great mobility of Docker without the
Docker. It's just a fucking binary. The potential for remote rootkits
among many other things is just astounding. Fuck, I could even put *all*
of Metasploit into a single binary. I think I might finally have
something to present about at Defcon (not to mention KubeCon).

I just have to make something big now (like `fluff`, which is just big
enough) that supports Bonzai to start showing how people and begin to
create Bonzai supported, modular, composable applications so that people
can mix and match them together. I need to wrap something that already
exists as well.
