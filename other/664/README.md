# Chrometana Redirects Bing/Cortana to DuckDuckGo

I don't often search for thing graphically. When I do I simply press the
Super (Windows) key and enter the search terms. This immediately opens
the currently open web browser and searches, with Bing. It is by far the
fastest way to initiate a search in the graphic web browser without
having your hands leave the keyboard. But it's Bing.

Install the Chrometana Chrome extension redirects to other search
engines from Bing, which is fine for me. I have mine set to DuckDuckGo,
same as my command line searching.
