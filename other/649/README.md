# Docker Desktop Kubernetes Single-Node Cluster

The Kubernetes that comes with Docker Desktop is nice, but it's *not*
Kind. Honestly, if people are using Windows for Kubernetes applications
development and testing there is something wrong with their world view
that cannot be easily corrected. I was mostly curious to see if Docker
has somehow embedded `minikube`, `kind`, or `microk8s`, but doesn't look
like it.
