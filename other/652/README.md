# Ericsson Estimates Kubernetes on Metal 30% Cheaper

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/1Y-LcBVhovo>

Ericsson (which made Erlang) had this to say in an article about the
benefits of Kubernetes on bare metal:

> Ericsson estimates that the TCO savings for deploying Kubernetes on
> a bare metal compared to a virtualised infrastructure can be as high as
> 30 percent, depending on application and configuration.

Keep in mind that Ericsson has long been reputed to be one of the
champions of high-performance computing --- especially through-put and
functional approaches (which is why Erlang is so big).
