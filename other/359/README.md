# What is a 'Learning Lab'?

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/guUZgjC6wFo>

* GitHub repo that contains exploration and notes
* Too much stuff to fit into a zettel
* Has value on its own (people might want to fork)
* Versioned notes and code combined
* Enables tracking history of learning and changes
* Helps to alleviate problems of bad memory
* Gives a sense of control over highly complicated things
* Use a single monorepo `lab` or consistent prefix `lab-k8s-*`
* Has specific goal or scenario in mind
* Include a chronological `README.md` for each
* Sort of old school idea of documenting research
* Part of RWX method
