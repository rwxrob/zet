# Why not Windows 11?

*My computer won't run it.*

There is a strong chance your two-year old computer won't support it
either. This is why organizations seem to be overwhelmingly ambivalent
about the Windows 11 upgrade. I doubt anyone will upgrade for the next
2-5 years. It's a shit-show. The good news is that all the best stuff in
WSL2 (including X11 support) is backported to Windows 10 if you know how
to get it (like gWSL).

In another cash-grab, Microsoft has forced people to upgrade their Intel
machines (as they always have because of their cozy relationship with
Intel chip makers). 

I have a kick-ass MSI gaming tower that is two years old and I'm told I
do not "have TPM enabled" but also that I cannot enable it because "my
device doesn't support it." As much as I love Linux on the WSL2 desktop,
this shit remains annoying enough to call out when it affects me.
