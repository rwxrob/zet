# Isolated Zettelkasten Repos are Searchable

One great advantage of creating a single GitHub repository for
Zettelkasten repos is that the search against that repo is limited to
the content under that Zettelkasten, which has already been grouped in a
way that makes sense to want to search independently from the other
potential ZK repos. For example, say I want to [search just my logs] for
*Zettelkasten* content. Here's the same search against [all my zets]. I
was able to copy and paste the references easily in the Markdown:

```markdown
[search just my logs]: <https://github.com/rwxrob/logs/search?q=zettelkasten>
[all my zets]: <https://github.com/rwxrob/zet/search?q=zettelkasten>
```

If I wanted to expand to others I easily could without invoking a bunch
of stuff I don't want.

At one point I was even combining lab and codebook content in with my
logs and zettel (notes) and even my schedule. That's just stupid looking
back on it now. Using this automated indexing and search capability that
GitHub provides for free --- without any coding on my part --- is
clearly the way to go --- yes, even if it does create a dependency on
GitHub. After all, GitHub is just too big to fail and they can never
block search functionality like this to their end users (even if they do
turn evil one day and charge for us to host or mirror there).
