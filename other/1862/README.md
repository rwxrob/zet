# Consider how names will appear in documentation

I have to confess that sometimes I will use a name that is not quite perfect just so that it will alphabetically appear next to other similar stuff in the documentation. For example. `ErrPush` is awkward, but `PushError` would be a page of documentation away from `Error` and `ErrStack` and the reset.
