# Power Searching with Zettelkasten and GitHub

One of the most amazing advantages of combining Zettelkasten and GitHub
is the exhaustive search possibilities. This applies equally do doing
`git -i grep ...` searches from the command line. No more wondering
where that note about that one thing was kept, or what the URL was, or
waiting around for whatever search engine to crawl my page, or building
my own word indexing tools. All of that is 100% covered by `git grep`
and GitHub. It is truly amazing and so easy to setup. It's taken all the
wind out of my sails to do anything more with KEG except provide a way
to register, share, and follow one another. But that can all be done
simply with RSS now and the RSS feed provided by GitHub.
