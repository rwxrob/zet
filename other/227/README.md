# YouTube Live Streaming Sucks

YouTube is trying to chase Twitch but fails is all the ways that
*really* matter:

* Impossible to browse live streams meaningfully
* Abysmal API with polling
* No community building at all

YouTube is *great* for publishing videos. It's fucking horrible for
streaming and they is no indication that will change even with a
concerted effort. They just don't have people working there that
understand the more subtle but critical reasons people love Twitch. (I
know I didn't.)
