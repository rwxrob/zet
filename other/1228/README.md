# Learn InfiniBand For High Performance Network Work

I have had a lot of experience with Ethernet (of course) but absolutely
zero experience with InfiniBand because access to it usually requires
there be a high-performance computer cluster around of some kind. Here's
one of those things that going to a *good* school might have provided.
Another option would be to intern for any project related to HPC
deployments, which would probably require extensive hardware and network
experience to qualify for in the first place.

Given the footprint of InfiniBand within the Enterprise for HPC this
needs to be elevated in priority for anyone looking into infrastructure
engineering as an occupation.
