# Use Nitter.net for Better Twitter

Friend on Twitch just showed me <https://github.com/zedeus/nitter> which
makes everything so much more readable from Twitter. Looks like it is
FOSS so that's cool. I've been looking for a better to display an
isolated set of important Twitter people next to each other as a
replacement for bad tech blogs and high noise-to-signal Twitter people.
