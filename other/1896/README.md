# Return to daily Ashtanga yoga practice

In 2023 I'm returning to a daily Ashtanga yoga practice. The Ashtanga limbs touches on every aspect of life really, not just to get back into shape. I need Ahimsa to get less ranty.

I found my 2016 Yoga journal. I really need to take pictures or scan each of the pages. It was such a major part of my life, still is. I feel like I've declined a lot from it. I let other priorities --- good priorities --- take over. I mean, how did I ever have time to write *by hand* in a journal every day about every pose I did that day. Just *doing* the poses takes at least 70 minutes for half-primary with a proper Śavāsana. It's time to start again.

* Daily half-primary practice
* Saturdays and moon days off
* Memorize the Ashtanga limbs and go over them daily
* Daily yoga journal (zet) entries (by limbs)
* Restore pseudo-Vedic diet
* Daily yoga reading (20 min minimum) for all limbs
* Daily meditation or yoga nidrā (10 min minimum)
* Memorize Sanskrit yoga pose names (again)

None of this is new to me. I did this daily for all of 2016 and most of 2017 and even before that when I was single and first got into it. This stuff is *required* if you are going to complete any level of serious yoga instructor training.
