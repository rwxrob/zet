# "Info Commands" is What I am Calling Them

Some people call them "bang commands", but they have a larger scope than
those that provide information and act has hyperlinks once did in the
past. *Info commands* are single words that begin with a bang (\!) and
pull up an *info node* that fits under 380 characters (an arbitrary, but
good, size set by Twitch/IRC). This size also fits well in Tweets. And
God knows the world is obsessed with bite-sized information these days.

```yaml
hacker: &hacker >-
  ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’» Hacking is a mind-set. Hackers figures shit out, !autodidacts who
  make stuff do what they want in unexpected ways. Hackers learn more
  about than the original creators. That's it. Hackers are, therefore,
  pragmatic scientists. They !RWX their way though life for fun and
  profit. Learn to think like a hacker. You'll be smarter for it. Hack
  the planet!

hackers: *hacker
```

I'm using YAML for them with the title as the key and a reference link.
I generally start them with emojis of some kind as a way to roughly
categorize them. I don't think I'll every formalize that. It just
ensures that info command output doesn't get mixed up with real output
from me if my bot is running as me. I can have synonyms as well with
YAML.

The info command tags themselves also make amazing Twitter and zettel
tags, so there can be some interlinking using that.
