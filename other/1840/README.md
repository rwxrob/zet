# ðŸ“ž Are there Linux "front-end" CLI dev jobs?

Yes. But they don't call them CLI "front end" developers (even though they probably should). Technically, "front end" is the part the user uses, but the Web and graphics people have commandeered it (same with "API").

You're best bet is to look for jobs that require languages that are common for command-line UI tooling --- especially Go. Tools created in Go are statically linked single binaries that require no other installation and contain very powerful "batteries included" packages for doing most things developers want to do from *any* command line (not just Linux/UNIX).
