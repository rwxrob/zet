# TODO: Programming Career Paths

> Programming will be in everything. Don't just learning programming.
> Learn an industry, something you like, and then learn the programming
> required for that. (Grandpa Wilde)

Those words from my Grandpa were really true in 1986, and are even truer
today. But I would suggest these days you have to combine programming
with one of a few other skill-based specializations that go with a
particular industry and career.

1. Programming + Machine Learning (Tensorflow, etc.)
2. Programming + Operations (Linux, Containers, Kubernetes, etc.)
3. Programming + Electronics (Computer Engineering)
4. Programming + Math & Statistics ("Data Science")
5. Programming + Web Protocols (HTTP, REST, GraphQL, etc.)

I've always hated the made-up term ***software engineering*** because it
feels like it is reaching, particularly for web development (and Linus
agrees). But for these skills combinations it makes sense. You *are*
engineering solutions no matter what industry you choose.

**Programming + Web Protocols** is a tough category because it is
required for many of the others, but technically it can be
a specialization unto itself. This is not "Fullstack Developer" stuff,
it's far more than that. It's learning to communicate with and create
the core underlying protocols upon which web applications are built.
