# Beards filter out women I would not like

Listening to someone talking about advice to "get women" and one of the people in the chat said, "shave that neck beard" and all I could do was laugh. My beard has been the thing that gets the women I'm interested in the most, um, "hot" (and I have plenty of objective proof).

The truth is, be yourself, that's what attracts women: authenticity. The more you pretend to be something you're not, the more that energy will convey to *everyone* around you.

And, if you don't like your authentic self? Don't get sad, get busy. Make the changes in your life that bring you closer every hour to that person you *want* to be.
