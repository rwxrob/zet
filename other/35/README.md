# Daily News/Coffee Uploads to YouTube

Decided that I'll be uploading my most unflattering videos possible
daily, the ones where I just wake up and talk about news and the
schedule and what happened the day before, sort of like a "stand up" in
other contexts but definitely without the formality.

Eventually, I need to script the automatic creation of YouTube videos
from VODs. Perhaps StreamElements does this and I'm just not yet aware.
