# Tags Over Categories

Tags are supported by almost every modern content sharing service
because they allow quick, flexible, and easy categorization without
overthinking it. The tags that you find yourself using the most can then
be gleaned from their usage instead of having to get them right up
front.

Because of this, I've decided to use tags over categories in my
zettelkasten content organization. I've also decided not to include
Twitter-specific tags (like \#100daysofcode) and add those as options to
`zet post` instead because they just clutter up the meaning of the tags
on each zettel. This also eliminates the need to put colon-separated
prefixes in the titles.

At one time I was against tagging since it has been abused by other
zettelkasten 'tools' that remove the cognitive process of regularly
reviewing what is in your zettelkasten, but adding tags judiciously
leverages the modern searchability advantage modern technology has
offered to the zettelkasten approach. Luhmann clearly would have used it
had it been available to him.
