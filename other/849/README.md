# Prefix 'Figure:' Required for Figure Zettels

I've decided that having the word *Figure* actually in the titles is
critically important to consumption of figures as knowledge within the
zettelkasten approach, mostly because they were never part of the
original and I want it clear to everyone that the titled zettel is, in
fact, just a figure with a very verbose description.

Figure zettels can never contain discussion and analysis of the
*content* of the image. The only text allowed is to very verbosely
describe what is actually in the image (as if describing it in
excruciating detail to a blind person). 

This description not only provides the ultimate in knowledge
accessibility for all, but will provide the maximum find-ability for
that figure after I inevitably forget what it's called and where I put
it, something that has constantly plagued me when it comes to images and
illustrations. I might actually be able to find these pictures now.

Hell, I'm inclined to start singling out special photos from my family
history and putting them into my personal zettel as a method of creating
a running, illustrated, personal biography. (Now that is something my
Mom would be proud of.)
