# Live Streamer Utility: `live`

Been polishing up the `iam` bash script (renamed `live1`) I've been
using and it occurred to me that I would actually start logging the
modes and even combine them into a log that displays on the Twitch about
page. I've also been thinking of a way to regularly export the Google
calendar stuff in a way that can be updated as a profile text component
instead of using an extension that doesn't work on mobile. That way
people could see quickly what has happened and what is planned at one
glance.
