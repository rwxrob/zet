# Stop Using ChallengeReponseAuthentication, Deprecated

From `man sshd_config`:

```
     KbdInteractiveAuthentication
             Specifies whether to allow keyboard-interactive authentication.
             The default is yes.  The argument to this keyword must be yes or
             no.  ChallengeResponseAuthentication is a deprecated alias for
             this.
```
