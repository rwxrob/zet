# Okay to Bleed Music if Not Publishing

Realized something about IRL streaming that actually allows me to listen
to music while still streaming it (on channel 2, of course) without
worrying about the bleed that could get the video muted or blocked on
YouTube. Since auto-publishing VODs is an invitation for disaster --- no
streamer should ever enable it --- you don't have to worry about the
bleeding because that video is never going to make it into any VOD. It's
a simple thing, but very useful and makes it more fun for the streamer
to do boring things on stream that would normally not get streamed (like
the regular admin stuff every streamer has to do weekly).
