# Getting Back Into Daily Twitch "Walk/Talk"

I stopped because of Winter, actually. But Spring has sprung and I feel
great! Time to get outside. Also, I think it goes well with the muted
streaming during my coworking since I don't talk at all these days (but
get *so much shit done* that is definitely worth it). Now that I have a
car of my own (again) I can drive us to far off places to do the walk
(within 30 minute drive).
