# JSON5, "JSON for ~~Humans~~ Morons"

God I hope this shitty project dies the death it deserves. It tries to
make JSON into YAML in many ways by adding extremely unnecessary shit to
the syntax that will unnecessarily slow JSON parsing to a fucking crawl.

Of course, this came from the web community, the rulers of cluelessness.
It absolutely blows my mind how stupid this entire project is. How much
it shows a complete and utter lack of understanding of the core reasons
and design principles of JSON in the first place. JSON is for the most
efficient structured data transfer possible, period. *That* is the
reason JSON is the lingua-franca of all things on the Web these days. It
is the reason it *destroyed* XML despite all the momentum it had. It is
the reason that JSON tags are *built into* modern languages like Go and
Rust.

Breaking all of that just for your shitty comments and trailing commas
just shows what a fucking moron you are for trying to use JSON in that
way in the first place. It demonstrates a fundamental lack of clue, of
any actual sanity, and a solid reason that web developers should *never*
allowed anywhere enterprise data systems and protocols.
