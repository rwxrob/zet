# Bonzai `help.Cmd` now supports system pager detection

I cannot say how much that makes me happy to see it see my `less` configuration and automatically make sure I see the top of a lot help page. This was keeping me from really investing time in creating exhaustively long documentation that travels with a Bonzai stateful command tree and all the branches as the primary source of documentation for the tool. I found myself doing things in README.md files and such, but now everything is just in the command itself. RTFM retains its meaning, it's just that the commands bring their FM with them.

Time to get busy really documenting all the nuances of `keg` and including an interactive tutorial right in the command as well so it is drop-dead simple to get started.
