# Control Twitch Ads Proactively with Ad Breaks

TL;DR: Take two 90 second ad breaks to build up 50 minutes of
uninterrupted time in order to have focused learning sessions.

Ever been interrupted by a Twitch ad in the middle of an important
question you had? Or worse, the answer to your question you finally got
the streamer to answer? Well, if you have, it is time to help your
favorite streamer take control of their ad interruptions.

Twitch is going to show ads no matter what to your viewers. This isn't
something that anyone can disable easily without subscribing. Even if
they use MVP, the stream is still blank during that time --- even if the
streamer is still doing something. This inability to control when the
interruptions happen is so frustrating I've heard people will leave a
stream just because of it, but consider how unnerving this would be
during an educational live stream where every second counts (like when
trying to cram a ton of learning into something like the Beginner
Boost).

People can certainly use ad blocking, but assuming everyone is using it
is just not an option. You don't want to punish those who are not by
forcing to watch a random ad anytime Twitch feels like showing it to
them (and interrupting you in the process). Plus, ad blocks are
unreliable and Twitch it constantly fighting to break them.

Thankfully, if you show an ad over 90 seconds you get 30 minutes without
ads. And if you to 3 minutes that time is added to the amount of time
before the next add will show.
