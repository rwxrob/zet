# I Really Do Not Like GPLv3

Once upon a time I was ambivalent toward the entire GNU project. Now I'm
inclined to replace each and every thing that I depend on that is
licensed under GPLv3. I mean, I fucking *hate* what they did with that.
People will have to their own research and come to their own
conclusions, but knowing that I am using anything at all that is under
GPLv3 makes my skin crawl.

Perhaps the toughest dilemma I face in this regard is my beloved bash.
Bash is --- and will always be --- GPLv3, the darling at the center of
all "free software" that Stallman would smile his pedophilic creepy ass
smile down upon. (May he ever remain in Mexico.) Seriously, these people
have very questionable ethics and the worst part is, like flat-Earthers,
they are in complete denial that any of their shitty dogma might just be
fucking wrong.

Fortunately, I'm dropping my bash dependency slowly but surely. I will
always suggest people learn it. Zsh is shit in comparison and bash is
the standard Linux shell and likely will always remain the standard for
decades to come. It is an interactive shell after all, so bundling bash
with your hardware distro is very unlikely anyway. That's where Alpine
and BusyBox come it, and, yes, that is where Bonzai, and eventually
Bonzai Shell will come in. My point is that Bonzai is going to save me
from all that GPLv3 shit as I rewrite everything I need in it.
