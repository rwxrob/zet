# ðŸ“ž What are your thoughts on ChatGPT?

Why? Why are people interested in this? I just don't get it. It's an "open prototype" (not finished). However, I do think the prospects for one-on-one adaptive mentoring and education are very compelling. Just don't have it do your homework for you if you actually want to improve yourself.
