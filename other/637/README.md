# What goes in `zet` and `log`?

The `log` is only for chronological stuff that you don't want to show up
in a search of `zet` which is full of content that could eventually make
it into an article or other publication. Log information would never be
included in such things. Therefore, it makes sense to keep `log` and
`zet` separate Zettelkasten repos.
