# Matthew 7:21-23 should be required for every Christian to memorize

This is especially true for those who think that Trump is somehow the fucking Messiah. The Bible that these people claim to revere is *very* clear on this point. Trump has a one-way ticket to the worst part of Hell if all of this shit turns out to be true. He's pretty damn close to most *actual* Christians' idea of the "anti-Christ".
