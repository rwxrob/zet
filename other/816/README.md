# Learn Mac, Windows, and Linux for Best Results

TL;DR: Use a Mac laptop, Windows desktop, and Linux servers.

This combination gives you experience with the best tools for the job:

* Windows is best for gaming and 3D applications (SolidWorks)
* Mac is best for writing, sound engineering, media and portability
* Linux servers are best for hosting and hacking

Just about finished configuring my new Macbook Pro for work (WSL2
doesn't work with AnyConnect VPN, etc.) and I've been having a poingant
reminder how important it is for people to learn all three major
operating systems. 

People get fucking tribal over this shit, to their great determinent.
Some idiots tell you that all you should ever learn is Linux, Linux on
the desktop, Linux for gaming, Linux for hacking, that somehow using
a "propietary" system makes you dirty (even if you blow away their
productivity and annual salary). Most people telling you this shit are
hypocritically hiding their dark secret that they use Windows or Mac at
work or school, or, as I have often encountered with these types of
Linux zealots, they are unemployed and usually smell pretty bad.

The "linux-only" attitude is completely stupid and unrealistic.  The
fact of the matter is that any "hacker" should be productive using
whatever they have in front of them, even if they fucking *hate* that
they do and everything the company has stood for. For me, this is Apple.

Consider these uncomfortable truths:

* Most companies on planet Earth require Windows or Mac workstations
* Macs are the largest UNIX distribution
* Windows WSL2 brings Linux power to desktop users
* Most Internet servers and mobile devices run Linux
* Most security vulnerabilities are targeted at Windows
* Most network hardware (routers, etc.) runs BSD UNIX

One of the things that turned me off about prepping for OSCP was the
focus on learning PowerShell (which is just so fucking awful), but the
fact of the matter is that you *must* learn to become a hacker or
enterprise systems infrastructure engineer. It does not matter how much
I hate it. That's the difference between reality and things people on
the Internet/YouTube love to rant about. They have no fucking clue about
the reality facing *real* technology professionals because, honestly,
they've never had a real tech job in their fucking lives (let alone be
able to do complex systems engineering or hacking beyond running
script-kiddy attacks).

It comes back to the Marvel Dr.  Strange comparison. The "ancient one"
employed dark magic to fight for the greater good. We can use these
proprietary technologies (when we have to) to work against the things
about these proprietary companies that we find to be truly evil. We are
using their power against them to ultimately reform them or bring them
down. It's a more nuanced approach to the radicalism and clueless
zealotry that defines more Linux fanatics (of which I definitely once
was as a kid).
