# Keep Linux, Avoid Windows, If You Have Choice

Recently, I have been tempted by workspace containers to put Windows
back on my main system. But for the last week since having that thought
the Windows gods have decided to convince me what a fucking stupid
thought that was. As I stare at Windows getting rebooted today (like
most days) because the VPN hung I am reminded what shit Windows has
always been. I have come to take 46 days of uptime for granted on my
Linux PopOS! system. I keep forgetting that Windows *never* has anything
close to that. Then I'm reminded how fucking insecure Windows is. How
having a Russian installed keyboard will keep you from getting hacked in
documented cases. How Linux is practically never targeted and has so
many more possibilities to prevent such attacks. I'm reminded what a
piece of steaming shit WSL2 is compared to Linux running on the
hardware. I'm reminded that Docker Desktop on Windows has updated at
least two times since installing and every fucking time requires I
reboot my computer. No thank you, I'll keep Linux as my host operating
system thank you very much. Windows has never been --- nor ever will be
--- anywhere nearly as good as Linux on hardware.
