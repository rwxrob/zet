Had to look this one up. I actually really like the definition and hope
it always applies to me. But I'll always be biased, everyone is, as long
as I am as aware of them as I can be. Being "based" means being "biased"
but being aware of them and knowing why. This goes along with "strong
opinions, weakly held."
