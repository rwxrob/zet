# Is the meaning of artificial life same as organic?

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/aZeXyaz5bbQ>

If a computer/robot could function the same as a person, would the
meaning of its 'life' be different?

1. What is artificial life?
1. How does it relate to artificial intelligence?
1. What *is* life? What is existence?
1. Woz thinks we are too far away to think of it
1. "We must endeavor to fall alone so we can succeed together"
1. "Pain and sentience are part of the same thing, which is ego"
1. "Sentience" and "alive" are terribly different
