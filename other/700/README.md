# CODD Container Operating Docker Desktop

My live-stream friend @psypheric1 noted that I was making a "CODD" and
even though he was just making up an acronym I think it'll stick.
Shaving the yak has its advantages. I can take this thing anywhere!

"We only allow Windows."

"No problem!"

"We only have Macs in our company."

"Okey. Dokey."

I HAVE A CODD THAT WILL RUN ANYWHERE! MUAHAHAHAHAHA!

As @psypheric1 says, "OS Independence ... open seas and smooth sailing
with CODD".

Oh, how about this one:
