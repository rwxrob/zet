# Ubuntu Spams Notifications to All Desktop Users

Just when I thought I didn't need further proof that Linux on the
Desktop is shit the leading enterprise desktop Linux distribution
(Ubuntu) decides to force *everyone* to accept or reject their Desktop
Pro solicitation, so they are no better than Microsoft, at all. Apple is
a lock-in ecosystem. Microsoft is a semi-locked-in ecosystem that allows
a full, unfettered Ubuntu (or any Linux kernel) to be run on their
proprietary system. And Ubuntu just proved their intent: become *the*
enterprise desktop distro. And, why wouldn't they. That has been
Shuttleworth's intent all along. He just never said anything about
shilling FOSS software to those users every fucking day.

So until anyone can show me a viable Linux desktop distro that any
conservative organization would allow their workers to use, well, I'll
just eat popcorn and watch the madness play out. I've accepted the
reality that Microsoft (yes Microsoft) has --- by far --- the best Linux
Desktop distribution on the market today (as of Feb 2022). That might
change tomorrow, but that is the state of affairs today.
