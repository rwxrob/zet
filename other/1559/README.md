# Hey Look, Adam Mentioned Me, First ;)

Thanks for the nice thoughts, Adam. Wow, first on the list. I look
forward to watching your streams as well. Here's my favorite part:

> You learn more practical intermediate skills from pairing with
> experienced developers (tacit knowledge) than you will learn from
> drilling on LeetCode problems (deliberate practice).

This is the same point I keep harping on that *mentorship* is the truest
form of education (and the origin of the "guru" approach, as warped and
cliche as that term has become).

I just learned the term "tacit knowledge" from Adam. See, this is why
the Knowledge Exchange Grid (KEG) just be made. We all learn from each
other. All of humanity progresses when we put down our concerns for idea
ownership and increase the trade of ideas. Anyone who plays Civ knows.
Trade is always good for everyone.
