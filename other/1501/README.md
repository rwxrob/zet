# Compose Key on Linux PopOS! to Right Super

Finally figured out how to make a trademark (™) and copyright (©)
symbols without searching for them on the Internetz. In Gnome Desktop
there is Keyboard -> Compose Key that you can set. I set mine to
`Right-Super` since I never, ever use it. It will even change the cursor
to indicate I am in compose mode. Trademark for me now is `Right-Super
tm` and copyright `Right-Super Co`. I image their are others as well.
