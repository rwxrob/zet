# Complete major version of enterprise REST API in Go at work

This is the most important project at work. It will have long lasting implications for the entire company and eventually serve to reduce the existing technical dept (in 18,000 lines of Perl). This is by far the best way for me to produce value for my current employer. Obviously, the work to keep our Kubernetes cluster up and running is valuable, but we have a lot of people helping with that, and only two who know how to code Go at such a scale.
