# I'm pretty public because it might end up helping someone

I'm a very public person because I sincerely want to help others find their own path. I want people to find value in this content *as is*. There are tons of spelling and grammar errors and opinions
and mistakes and realizations I was wrong because it is meant to be an organic place to dump thoughts, not a final publication (although the idea is to use a Zettelkasten to produce such things).
