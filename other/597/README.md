# "Practical" is an Insult in Academic Circles

When I read that to be labeled "practical" in academia has long been one
of the worse insults invented by the fucked up "educational"
establishment I could do nothing more than nod, not in agreement, but
because it makes so much sense that those pedantic, bombastic,
ineffectual assholes would label people producing practical value
through through exploration and experimentation as less than others who
spend their entire lives stuck in their heads never trying anything out.
Such academics can go fuck themselves while the rest of humanity
continue to learn through practical means, as it always has. We don't
need their kind. We are too busy getting shit done.
