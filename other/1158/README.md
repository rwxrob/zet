# Expiring Knowledge By Design

Having a granular Zettelkasten Git/GitHub repo means that each zettel
directory can be audited for age and reported automatically as a
reminder to make sure it is still relevant. As I'm going through all my
own content now I realize how critically important that is. Everything
from broken links, to completely new ideas and takes on things are a
risk and a liability if they are not maintained. This may be the first
time I've ever encountered a system that supports *proactively*
maintaining updated content.
