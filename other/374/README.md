# Knowledge Repos

I accidentally used the word "knowledge repo" in writing up something
today and it sort of stuck with me. The full term is "knowledge
repository" and that is *exactly* what all these Git/GitHub repos are, a
place to dump, shape, and share knowledge as it happens with as little
overhead as possible. I'm going to start using that term a lot more. A
Zettelkasten repo is just one form or method of maintaining a *knowledge
repo*.

This is further evidence that I'm moving away from many of the KEG
concepts and creating more and more dependencies on Git and GitHub,
which is a violation of the KISS principle I started with for KEG, but
should be fine for getting shit done. I need something now before I
further simplify it. I suppose, however, that nothing is stopping anyone
from following the dame digital method without having Git involved at
all, perhaps just in a local directory and backed-up to a USB drive.
Since that is *exactly* what Git is good at, it's a natural pairing.
