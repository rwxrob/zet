# Web Developers are Not Fucking Software Engineers

Stop fucking calling yourself a "software engineer" if all you know is
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You're a developer, not a fucking engineer.
In Canada you can be fined for calling yourself an engineer without an
*actual* engineering degree, you know, like chemical, mechanical,
structural, civil, and all the other non-bullshit titles that represent
hard engineering skills. You *might* become a software engineer if you
actually architect all the elements at a collective level and apply, oh
I don't know, some *fucking math and data structures and algorithms* to
your code. Guess what, that's now what web developers do. So stop
calling yourself a "software engineer" to make up for how much you
actually suck. Just own that you are a one-trick-pony and expand you
*engineering* skills before throwing around that bullshit title.
Otherwise, everyone else who has been around a while will laugh their
fucking asses off behind your back. You're not a fucking "engineer."
