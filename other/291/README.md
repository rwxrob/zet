# Best Way to Build a Spotify Playlist

Create a playlist with the best possible song you could thing of that
represents it. Then go to that song's radio and select and add all of
those songs to your own playlist. Then listen to all of those and delete
the ones that you don't like. The go to the radios of all the remaining
songs and add all of them to the list and do the exact same thing, and so
on. That way you are creating an original playlist that is not dependent
on any of the others (and the tastes of those who made them).
