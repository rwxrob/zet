# Compiling Go Code is Critical Modern Skill

Being able to compile Go code is one of the top five most important
skills going into 2022 simple because it allows users to import what
they want and need and create their own executables. This assumption is
at the base of Bonzai design. While people can compile Bonzai trees for
others initially, the end goal is to have *every* individual tech able
to compile their own Bonzai tree just as easily as they would write a
shell script. (Many technologists can't do either, which is a fucking
atrocity (one friend called it "professional malfeasance") ---
especially after paying 10s of thousands of dollars on a college
education in tech.)
