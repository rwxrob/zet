# Use Caffeinated to Prevent Windows from Locking

When you don't have the option to change the timeout on your Windows
computer, but you know you are sitting right in front of it and just
working from another computer at the same time, and you are fucking sick
and tired of having to type the password just to see the screen you were
literally reading from in order to work from another computer and
another screen, then get [Caffeinated] a simple utility that does
nothing more than essentially wiggle the mouse once in a while (without
wiggling it). Your company may have security policies that frown on such
things, but most companies also frown on not getting a single fucking
thing done because your screen locks up ever five minutes because it
thinks you are not there looking at it. Besides, it is better and safer
than transforming your Windows machine into a socks proxy or SSH tunnel,
something that your company would likely frown upon way more than
keeping you laptop from locking while you are sitting in front of it.
