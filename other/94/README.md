# Why Do People Obsess About Keyboard Cams and Mics?

Just made the rounds on Twitch and apparently the cool thing remains to
have a fucking camera on you keyboard. I can't believe people with 12
point font --- unreadable on mobile devices --- will throw away that
screen real-estate just to show the fucking keyboard. If people are
*that* obsessed with seeing you type every word rather than
promote better readability they might have a problem.

What is even weirder to me is when they put mics on their keys to let
everyone here the sound. But, I get that for some people this is just
very calming.
