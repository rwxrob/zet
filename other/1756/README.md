# Twitch supports better music options

I was tempted recently to look at YouTube again. Then I remembered my favorite thing about streaming to Twitch is how they support playing music, any music. Twitch even committed code to OBS and setup the back-end systems to prevent "track 2" from being saved to the VOD. That will *never* happen on YouTube, even if they could pull it off, and had the motivation. YouTube has setup a different (stupid) view of the entire music world. Twitch has been at the forefront championing music mixing, sampling, even playing it live. Twitch would never implement something as draconian and fucking stupid as immediately interrupting someone's live stream just because some fucking dumb-ass AI *thinks* a person is streaming copyrighted content. No, Twitch has made lots of mistakes in the past, but Twitch is *not* that stupid, they are not as stupid as YouTube. Even if they were forced to do that, Twitch would immediately cease to exist because more than half Twitch streamers would no longer be willing to take that risk, or would take it with the bigger audience they could muster on YouTube.

So Twitch, great job on everything you do to promote *true* streaming. If personal broadcasting is to continue to grow and become the new normal, the rest of the industry will need to catch up with what Twitch has done, and is planning further to do. I'm not leaving anytime soon, if ever.
