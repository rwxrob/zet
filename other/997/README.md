# When should I do yoga?

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/aXfx-DSOI74>

* After you have gone number two
* Usually in the morning after coffee
* Sometimes in the afternoon to stretch and wake up
* Sometimes outside, anytime
* Ashtanga suggests 6 days a week (Sat or Sun off)
* Ashtanga suggests "moon days" and women's "flow" days off
* Regularity is more important than intensity
* Yoga is more than just poses (Asana)
* "Every moment of every day" (some say)
