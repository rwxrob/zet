# Back to 24 Hour Streams and Community Chat

It's official (for now, at least). I'm back to 24 hour streaming most of
the time. It all started when I forgot to turn the stream off after
going AFK and when I returned I realized that now that I have a ton of
commands for people to use, and people are enjoying the music, and
chatting with each other, and helping each other, that I just have to
leave it on 24/7. I've just been changing to the Music category, and
believe me, there are a lot of other Music category streamers that just
leave on a Spotify list as well.
