# Markdown Reference Links Do Not Need to Be Last

There's really no need to put reference links at last in the document at
the bottom. In fact, it's probably a bad idea because it removes them
from the paragraphs that contain them. No, instead I prefer to put them
right after the section they appear in. That way cutting and pasting is
still an option and the paragraph remains more readable.
