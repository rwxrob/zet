# Reserving the Name `bon` for Bonzai Helper

I was lamenting the loss of `bonzai` as a repo and a command (since that
is the package name) but then I happened on the very obvious `bon`,
which means "good" in French. So the official name of the official
Bonzai helper command (for making new Bonzai branches, vetting, and
registering, etc.) is now `bon`.
