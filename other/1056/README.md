# Use `zet` Over `zk`

Just tested the word 'zet' on my phone and I could speak it and my phone
understood. The same is not true of 'zk'. So I will keep the `zet`
command as is even though `zk` is far easier to type. This allows the
`#zk` tag to be used to refer to zettelkasten stuff in general, while
`#zet` is specifically about the command.

    #zk #zet #spec
