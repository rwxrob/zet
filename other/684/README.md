# Need Twitch/Live/YouTube Bot with CI/CD

It's a no-brainer, but doesn't look like anyone has made one yet, a
Twitch/Cloudbot clone that actually updates all the configuration
settings from a GitHub repo with a web hook. Such a fucking simple idea.
Perhaps someone will get to it before I do. In fact, I could lobby to
get FOSS funding to create a service that does it for free. I mean, if
the Pokemon directory can get free hosting on Digital Ocean, why not.

My main motivator is actually education. It is so much more engaging and
interactive to have a bot there to intelligently answer questions as
well as respond to particular commands. Hell, this might even by my
perfect foray into machine learning. By keeping all the logs and the
most common commands that resulted from certain messages through chat
the model would determine the most expected thing to respond. I wonder
if nickwan_data would be interested in a project like that. I could see
the world really needing it. Bots that become intelligent about how to
respond to specific questions, be they for entertainment or education.

To start with, however, we just create all the commands we use and go
with that.
