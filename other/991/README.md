# Moving to Single `lab` Was Great Decision

As I go through this migration to another system I'm realizing how
monstrously advantageous it has been having all my lab/sandbox work in
one repo. I've had to comb through all my local git repos to make sure I
don't have any missing commits. And most of the work I do from day to
day is in the `lab` so it is all consolidated even if it wasn't saved
and related to completely separate efforts. I would have had to search
through dozens of lab repos the old way. 

This is one of those times where I really wonder what the hell I was
thinking before.
