# Q: How do I run Linux in Windows?

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/qMl985TbUrY>

1. Install MS Windows Terminal first
1. Do you want graphics with that (or just a terminal)?
1. Install WSL2 and use that (probably should install anyway)
1. Install a virtual machine (VirtualBox)
1. Install Docker Desktop *or* Minikube and then *any* Linux container
1. Using a VM or container allows you to fully experiment

Also rans:

* Cygwin is not Linux
* mingw is not Linux
* Git-Bash is not Linux
* Not "dual booted" (not "in" Windows)
* Not installing onto "bare metal"
* Not `ssh`-ing into remote Linux host
