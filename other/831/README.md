# Learn GitHub *Enterprise* API

I'm struggling because some of what I've learned about the GitHub API is
only for the public one. The GitHub Enterprise is different. For
example, it is really picky about doing anything without a token. But
the most annoying thing about the Enterprise API is how unable I am to
test it without actually having GitHub Enterprise installed. Turns out
they have a "Learning Lab" that requires you do install a bunch of shit
up-front, and requires you to have an Enterprise license.

I do have access at work, but I'd rather not bang on that until I have
things ironed out. There's just no where to practice for developers. I
think this is a pretty big oversight on GitHub's part. It's the same for
other applications (perhaps the most painful is ElasticSearch, which you
cannot even use at all without an enterprise license even though
everyone requires you know it). (Reminds me of the old IBM DB2 days when
they gate-kept the *shit* out of that. Only people who paid thousands of
dollars where even allowed to learn how to use it *at all*.)
