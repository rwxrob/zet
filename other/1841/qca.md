Q: Hey I just stumbled across your video about helping people learn
   Linux and thought it was a great talk. Personally I am wanting to
   teach free classes to disadvantaged kids about how to use computer
   and learn some basic scripting skills that can help them in many
   kinds of employment (e.g. using Cron jobs to produce daily reports
   from data in various excel files - basic mundane office tasks). I
   think in modern times these kinds of skills can provide a lot of
   economic mobility for people in a vast variety of typical office jobs
   and you don't need to be a full on programmer to do this kind of
   stuff. Just a small bit of knowledge in this domain goes a long way.

   It was great to hear your perspective in hosting classes and the
   issues you encountered. Would you have any advice to someone like
   myself who wants to provide these kinds of classes for free,
   specifically targeting kids who come from poorer families and are
   less likely to be able to provide for resources like laptops? Is it
   feasible? Is it out of place to contact schools? Should I try to host
   it with a school or do it independently; like a weekly class at a
   local library etc.?
