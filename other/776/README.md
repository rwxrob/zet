# Zettelkasten User/Reader Assistance Ideas

Obviously, searching through a zettelkasten is the most important tool
to provide to consumers of a zettelkasten, but there are a few other
tools that I think I would want myself to keep track of my interaction
with it:

* Graphical representation with what has been read
* Display what has been read
* Display what has been read but updated since read
* Display what has never been read

I recently had a frustrating experience with documentation that takes a
graph model (Kubernetes web site) but doesn't provide these sorts of
navigational assistance tools. I felt like I was going in circles the
entire time. If I had some consistent indicator of whether I had even
been on that page, or even better, how much of that page I had read, I
would have been able to process all of it much more quickly. I also
would have had the intense FOMO from not knowing what I might have
missed along the way.

If we are going to pursue this non-linear form of content consumption we
*must* have a way to ensure the same level of reader confidence and
clarity is maintained that exists in more linear outline forms today.

The good news is that the granular nature of zettels makes them
incredible easy to track and mark providing well for any such system to
be overlaid on top of them.
