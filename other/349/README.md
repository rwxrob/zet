# Boost Badges: Levels

There are several levels of depth to any specific Boost Badge:

1. Basics (conversant, has sampled and mastered something minimal)
1. Essentials (working knowledge, just enough to explore and be dangerous) 
1. Proficiency (full professional proficiency, could be paid for)
1. Excellence (beyond proficiency, innovative application of)
1. Mastery (domain leader, able to instruct and expound about)

Each level has an implied title that depends on the specific badge.
Let's look at something like bash:

1. Bash User (can use the command line, history, tab completion)
1. Bash Coder (write simple scripts and own `bashrc` config)
1. Bash Programmer (can do anything in man page for an employer)
1. Bash Developer (designs complex applications and integrations)
1. Bash Master (could write book involving multiple projects)

Or, in Star Wars Jedi ranks:

1. Youngling
1. Padawan
1. Knight
1. Master
1. Councilor

Or, in hacker lingo:

1. `n00b`
1. `kiddy`
1. `h@xx0r`
1. `1337`
1. `0g`

Note that the knowledge and experience level moves up on a rather
exponential curve. Very few people will actually do the work required to
attain level five (or even four). Gaining *proficiency* is hard enough.
This allows a certain degree of meritocitous distinction for the few
who do go for the higher levels. Most will be satisfied with level
two and a few level threes as well. The point is, there's room for
growth for everyone. The content of levels one, two, and three has the
highest priority.
