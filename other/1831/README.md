# When a CEO has a soul, it shows

I cannot talk about the company I work for (on contract), but I just read the year-end letter from our senior executive and cannot overstate how impressed I am with the quality of this human being. Yes, it's possible to be an amazing person and also crazy, filthy, executive-level rich. This person just completely and totally proved it. It's a stark contrast to the absolute shit that Elon Musk has done to every company he's ever controlled.

I suppose this is validation of my direction to others to seek out those companies that you may not have heard of (mostly because they have substance and don't need the flash). When you do, you'll end up discovering that many of these companies (mine included) put most of those flashy SV companies to shame on multiple levels. This time it was just baseline human compassion and, um, not being clue-less.

I have a lot to be grateful for this holiday season. I could not have a better team and the amount of work we have is a lot, but its challenging, and most importantly, this *hugely* successful company actually has a heart and cares about the people who work there. It's been a core tenet of the company from the very beginning, and for that I'm also grateful.
