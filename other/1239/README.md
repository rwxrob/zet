# GCP (Google) Leading AWS (Amazon)?

Casual review of top careers with Kubernetes in the job description
today and *all* of them list GCP skills. About 70% list AWS. There is
clearly a shift going on and after sampling GCP the other day very
briefly I understand why. GCP's interface at almost every level blows
away AWS, which is fighting the technical debt of being the leader for
so long. I know of (internal/private) decisions of large multinational
companies with major initiatives going to GCP. They all have some AWS as
well, but all the new modern internal activity is based on GCP. I have
enough data to make my decision. I'm not learning any Amazon, only GCP
(for now). Learning a *single* cloud provider is a massive undertaking.
I just don't have time to keep current on all of them (even though I
could cross-train if needed).
