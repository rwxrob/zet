# Cloud-Native and Kubernetes Colearning, Oct 16, 2021

* Start with `kubeadm` for certs instead of own CA ...
* Which is not covered in the "the hard way"
* Discovered that the tutorial is completely useless
* Decided to use official docs instead (and struggle)
* (Skip ahead to 2:38pm to avoid ranting)
* Decided to create images for control and worker nodes
