# Focusing on CKAD, Kubernetes applications development

I've decided that I want to focus on the applications development (specifically "platform engineering") with regard to Kubernetes rather than focusing on its administration (which is still a main part of my job as well). CKAD just ties together with the REST API development in Go that I've been tasked with doing at work and frankly enjoy the most. It's what I always end up doing for any company I've work for in the past 30 years. I like connecting things for some reason.
