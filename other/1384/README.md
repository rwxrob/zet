# Golang is Self-Documenting

I love that if you follow the Go idioms you end up with drop-dead easy
code to read. It's not Python, but in many ways it is better because
your eyes are always left-justified while scanning and the important
stuff shows up first (identifiers before types). The syntax is so
completely clean that you almost never need explanatory comments so
commenting is usually redundant to just reading the code.
