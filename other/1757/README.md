#  Q: How do you stream and record for Twitch and YouTube with music?

Stream to Twitch with VODs active and music filtered out of VOD (track 2 in OBS). Record segments with OBS for YouTube during stream. (Remember to turn off music for them). Publish videos directly to YouTube the next day with descriptions (per affiliate/partner Twitch TOS). Send notification to Twitter/Mastodon/Discord of posted video.

After three years of experience with all this I can pretty definitively say that I've arrived at the best workflow and design for personal broadcasting if the most important thing is getting podcast-quality content out there as well as live-coding and streaming what you do as you enjoy doing it with your favorite music.

* Setup OBS to not send desktop audio to track 2 (usually music)
• Turn on VODs for Twitch so people see immediate past content
* Setup YouTube account and playlist if needed
* Announce streams through Discord and Twitter and Mastodon
• Live stream to Twitch *only*
* Do whatever you would do normally (with music if you like)
* Stop any music and hit the OBS record button to make videos for YouTube (better resolution, etc.)
* Take notes (`keg`) while making the video
* The following day, open up videos made yesterday, upload to YouTube in bulk
• Update the video descriptions from notes, publish each video with share to Twitter
