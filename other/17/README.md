# Belabox is the Future of IRL Live Streaming

Even though I'm going a different direction for now, the Belabox is
clearly the future for the Linux do-it-yourself-er over the long term.
Perhaps the biggest advantage is the teaming of different mobile modems
from different providers (as can be done with the LiveU product).
