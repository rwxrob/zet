# FORCEDENTRY, a Zero-Click iMessage Exploit from NSO

I can't help it. I'm a huge fucking fan-boy of NSO. I want to wear their
t-shirt. Maybe I'll even make one. I obviously don't agree with their
politics and targets (all of them at least), but my God, this exploit is
a complete thing of beauty. It makes me feel Antonio Salieri at the feet
of Mozart with just enough skill to see how beautiful it is, but never
be able to even conceive of it.
