# Books About JavaScript

* *The JavaScript Way* is my favorite. It is unassuming and direct and
  doesn't waste time on ancient, bad things like `var`. It just gets
  right to helping you learn modern JavaScript. It lacks some good
  exercises though, so you'll have to make your own, but that is good
  practice as well.

* *Eloquent JavaScript* is my next favorite. Also free, and it covers
  programming approaches in general as well.

* *Essential JavaScript* is a copyrighted book that is okay, but about
  the same as the free EJ so I cannot recommend it, even though I once
  did.

* *JavaScript, The Definitive Guide* recently got a complete update, but
  I have not yet looked at it. If it in indeed did get an update, it
  would be the most current guide for JavaScript in existence currently.

Avoid these like the plague:

* *You Don't Know JavaScript* is not only full of factual flaws and
  side-topics that have absolutely zero relevance, the author is a dick.
  Stay the fuck away from this book.

* *JavaScript, The Good Parts* is too fucking ancient to be relevant any
  more (like most everything else out there).

* Any book (or other resource) that teaches `var` instead of `let` and
  `const` and doesn't jump into fat-arrow functions at all telling you
  to use `function` keyword instead. That shit is *really* old at this
  point.
