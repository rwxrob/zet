# Decided to Create go Bonzai Branch

It was a tough decision, given the name. But I remembered that I only
have a `go.go` thing in my `z` branch right now, that no one else can
compose it in easily, and that I had needed to do exactly that at work
into a work tool (`hpc`). So breaking all the `go` stuff out into its
own branch makes sense. This also plays into my dream of bundling a go
binary into my `z`, probably best as an embedded file. I know that is
insane. It's 14MB. But I think it just might work. I could even
encapsulate all the go command line and supplement it with other stuff.
It's one of those "cool" but probably unwise things to do. Maybe not.
