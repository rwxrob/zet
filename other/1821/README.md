# Dealing with multiple forms of the same term, plurals, etc.

When dealing with terminology, one of the most annoying things a modern content creator will face is dealing with plurals and aliases for the same term. This because more troublesome when following the contention of using a **beacon** (double-star KEGML, `<b>` in HTML5) because how do readers and renderers deal with the very similar terms, **include list** and **include lists** for example?

The best solution is probably to create an index file containing the many-to-one relation and making such tools intelligent enough to use that, effectively rendering them all identically. This may seem obvious to most, but it's worth mentioning.
