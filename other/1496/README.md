# Stop Using Cygwin, Use Docker Instead

I keep reading about people's problems with Cygwin (the latest is not
working with TMUX and the TMUX maintainer saying "I have no idea how to
fix this"). But there is *absolutely no compelling reason to use Cygwin
in 2021*. Installing Docker Desktop and installing whatever Linux image
you want is far better at every level. In fact, if anyone can present a
*valid* reason to use Cygwin for *anything* I'll PayPal them \$5.
