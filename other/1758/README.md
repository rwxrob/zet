# GitHub Pages sites can be created with `gh` through API

So happy to find this. It means that I can include `git init` and `gh repo create` and another variation on `gh` that will actually setup the GitHub Pages configuration, turning it on. GitHub might have its failings and challenges, but their support for GitHub Pages through automation makes it an obvious choice for self-publishing KEG Web static sites.
