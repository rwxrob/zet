# Windows Terminal Breaks on `tmatrix`

For whatever reason, the new Windows terminal cannot handle something
being sent to the screen from `tmatrix`. Figures. Windows just isn't
worthy of Linux, yet. They are trying really hard and you have to commend
them for that. But this is yet more evidence that they don't even have
*basic* Linux functionality for most desktop users. I mean, if you can't
get the terminal ANSI escapes right you are just as bad as the buggy
Alacritty project. Neither of them are nearly as solid as something like
Gnome-Terminal, despite all the hate for an old and reliable terminal
that supports the full standards they get the job done better than any
of the upstarts and likely will for the next two years. People can
experiment all they want and that is good, but if you just want
something stable, stick with the old reliable stuff. Besides, this is a
fucking terminal we are talking about. What *really* needs to be
improved upon here?
