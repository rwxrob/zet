# Are you searching/browsing the Web from terminal?

Yes. It's really just a combination of Lynx and shell scripts, sometimes
a little `curl` in there. Here are the links to the relevant files:

* [duck](https://github.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/duck)
* [google](https://github.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/google)
* [bing](https://github.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/bing)

Then I just add the following aliases:

```sh
alias '?'=duck
alias '??'=google
alias '???'=bing
```

Plus there are some [videos] on it I made a long time ago:
