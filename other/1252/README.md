# "DevWars" is More Proof Humans Suck

Sitting here watching this complete waste of time between a bunch of web
developers competing over who can make a "Memory Game" the fastest and
all I can think is, "Why the fuck would you waste your time on this shit
with so much more important stuff out there --- that's entertaining ---
to work on?" I can't talk like this in public or people get pissed off
at whatever they call my "hate" for their lack of caring about
contributing useful shit to the world. Sometimes I wish I could really
just relax. But look around, how can anyone relax with all the stuff the
world *really* needs.

As a side note, it takes the web community to come up with this shit.
All using their own variation of a graphic editor, all coding on nothing
more than CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. 

Perhaps I can get behind the educational aspect of it. I imagine some
people find "competition" fun. But my inclination is to believe that a
better way to act on your competitive impulses is to spend your weekend
making shit that competes with status quo shit that is *really* bad.
Prove yourself in the field of *real* battle, not some contrived waste
of time.
