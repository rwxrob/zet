# Up at 3am, maybe I'll keep doing this

So I randomly woke up at 3am today and couldn't feel better. Very odd. I also had an urge to listen to the old yoga music and --- wait for it --- perhaps even *do* some yoga again. I felt so good when I did it daily even with my fat ass hanging out. I think I might try it again. Today I'll get the room back in order and more the stuff around so there's room again. Hell, the servers make it "hot yoga" already.

The way I figure it getting up at 3am and working through the day, collapsing sometime around 8pm is more productive, for me. I imagine if I threw in a nap in the afternoon (like a lot of tech bros do in Silicon Valley) that I could get the most out of the day. That would allow me to do yoga and go for a run/hike at noon as well.

I don't care it if makes me look like that-old-guy-who-gets-up-at-3am. Most monks and yogis have been doing this for a long time and consider 3-5am a sacred time for the best possible meditation. God knows I need more of that in my life, more meditation, less ranting. For some reason, yoga allowed me to channel the anger into passion and drive more than anything else in my life so far --- especially when combined with regular exposure to the Earth that I belong to, not fucking humanity. Humans fucking suck. The Earth doesn't. The Earth is my mother, the Sun my father. Everyone else can fuck right off.
