# What Programming Languages Do You Use?

I enjoy all languages (some more than others). But if I'm forced to
admit which languages I code it at least once per month (for fun or
pleasure) the list is rather short:

1. Bash (and sometimes `ash`)
2. Go
3. Perl
4. Python

For the record, I'm not including structured data languages (YAML, JSON)
or Markdown (which I "code" in hourly).
