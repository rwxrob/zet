# RT-Thread Smart, Embedded OS

I really want to look more into this entire branch of the tech industry.
The advances to operating systems and such are happening in embedded as
Linux sort-of settles into it's place. [RT-Thread Smart] is one example
of this. This mid-way between base runtime and full Linux kernel is
really the embedded sweet spot.
