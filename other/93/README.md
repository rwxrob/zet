# All Technologists are First Knowledge Workers

If we allowed ourselves to use a little polymorphism and inheritance you
could say that the "base class" (I just threw up a bit in my mouth) of
the *Technology Worker* is *Knowledge Worker*. In other words, you
cannot become the inherited class without first having the base class
(and all its methods implemented). This is what I have been struggling
with in the *Beginner Boost* series. People jump right into the tech
skills without even knowing how to read the fucking screen in front of
them to get their own answers, or type from home row, or speak English,
or do basic math. So I had to backup and make sure people at least have
these things covered first.
