# Sharing economy is a world-wide economy

This is why things like subscriptions and book prices are so unfair. It's why I won't be turning subscriptions on for Twitch. Someone getting help in the Philippines might not be able to afford that extra money, not nearly as much as an average American. Why punish them for living in a different part of the world for no fault of their own?

Instead, I think the best alternative is to get people to contribute what they can, fairly. Some will be able to donate a lot, others not at all. This depends on people's generosity and frankly never produces as much money, but it makes the most sense in a world-wide sharing economy.

Plus, make money doing something else so you can participate in the sharing economy without fear of death.
