# Using Twitch for Group Interactive Fiction Games

People call them by different names: "story games", "adventure games",
"MUD", "roleplay", and (my favorite) "interactive fiction". Since my
addiction to Zork I have loved them. They are also an amazing way to get
people to be creative writers. So it's not lost on me that by creating
an interactive fiction Twitch bot you can provide an entire
collaborative narrative that the group plays *together*. You'd have to
work out some way to arrive at consensus, so that, say, you have 100
people in the room, 51 of them would have to agree to do a specific
thing. You could isolate the number of people though some sort of
reputation or other score to limit the number of players currently. But
the bot could manage all that. In fact, I'm hearing from @HYNZZY on
Twitch that there is already a thing called Endless War that works in
Discord. Using Discord would allow the use of images in the chat. But
Twitch has the unique ability to change the video being displayed on the
screen. So an interactive fiction game on Twitch could be tied directly
to a series of videos, art or whatever. When I was in college a Spanish
professor won an award for Monte Video, a lazer-disk game filmed in
Mexico of interactions. That entire thing could be done today over
Twitch and upgrade infinitely..
