# UNIX Character Device to Driver, Byte at a Time

I've heard a lot about *block special devices* over the course of my
UNIX and Linux career but I've never understood what a *character device*
was until today when I did the research. Here's my favorite definition:

> A Character ('c') Device is one with which the Driver communicates by
> sending and receiving single characters (bytes, octets). Examples for
> Character Devices: serial ports, parallel ports, sounds cards.
