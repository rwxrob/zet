# I am a Fan of Chocolatey

Linux people be damned. Chocolatey is fine and wonderful if you are on
Windows, and yes, there are plenty of reasons to stay on Windows for
your daily driver, including gainful employment with a company that
won't allow Linux on the desktop (like most companies). Chocolatey
reduces that. I just `ssh win` from my Ubuntu Server VM running in
VirtualBox (my *main* daily driver) and boom, I can install anything as
admin because I have openssh running on the Windows side.
