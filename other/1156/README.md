# Added Kubernetes Colearning Back to Fridays

After talking with my manager about Fridays for training and how I've
got gaps in my Kubernetes knowledge I got the okay (same for anyone on
the team) to spend the afternoon working on nothing but training for
Kubernetes and other infrastructure related tasks. So it's back on the
calendar and I'll be sure to focus on that. My certs are probably not
going to be passable by August (when they expire) but I can try and cram
them in. I'll still take the tests to get the experience either way. I
hate that I've been so busy doing my job that I cannot actually be
better at the core part of my job, which is Kubernetes administration.
But, I think we have a chance to rectify that since we are working on an
OPs team API that our tools interface that will be a bona fide
Kubernetes microservices app itself. That should help with the CKAD
stuff.
