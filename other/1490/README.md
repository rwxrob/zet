# Do not But a Mac M1!

Right now is an incredibly difficult time to make this decision. The
direction of Apple and Google is to start using ARM for everything (the
same chip used in phones) but practically *nothing* that matters for
infrastructure engineering, security operations, and cloud-native
development runs on it including most Docker containers, Kubernetes, and
VirtualBox, the most important desktop virtualization software. 

These things are a complete disaster:

* VirtualBox or Vagrant do not run on it, at all, and not plans to fix
* Booting from USB has been completely disabled 
* Most containers are x86 only and won't run on it

Seriously, it is just not worth the money to get one of these.
