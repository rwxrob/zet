# Go Generics are Amazing for Rooted Node Trees

I'm totally blown away now that I finally got Go generics to work with
my QStack and Node types. The are absolutely so elegant I can never go
back. I'm so happy to have these major tools at my fingertips to build
all kinds of incredible things with. It would have been premature to
finish Bonzai and Fluff without having first built these absolutely
essential building blocks. I'm sure Go will add something like them to
the standard library. It's just a no brainer. Hell, I might even make my
own PR to have mine added. I wonder how one goes about doing that?
