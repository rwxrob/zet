# How do you reformat paragraphs like that?

I use the `gw` (cousin of `gq`) to do all my paragraph formatting
usually combined with a `}` to select up to the next blank line, but
sometimes with a `{` to select the everything above to the previous
blank line (which is *essential* for formatting Go comments that cannot
have a blank line before the actual code and the code gets mangled if
you don't).
