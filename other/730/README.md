# Coding Careers from US Bureau of Labor Statistics

The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 10% decline in
the number of "Programmer" jobs based on how they categorize it while
there is a 22% increase in demand for "Software Developers" and a 13%
increase in demand for "Web Developers". "Coder" gets no love at all. 

At a minimum, this means you might want to put the right titles on
your resume (no matter what your employer said your title was).

The BLS does get to the heart of the difference between the titles, a
difference with which I most agree:

> Computer programmers write and test code that allows computer
> applications and software programs to function properly.
>
> Software developers design computer applications or programs. Software
> quality assurance analysts and testers identify problems with
> applications or programs and report defects.  
>
> Web developers create and maintain websites. Digital designers
> develop, create, and test website or interface layout, functions, and
> navigation for usability.

I noticed that they added QA and Testers relatively recently (in 2021 I
think). They definitely did not lump them in before. This is also the
reason that I believe Web Developers got a hit in growth since sometime
between 2014 (when I started following this data) and 2018 suddenly a
significant portion of Web Developers suddenly dropped while Software
Developers went up.

Perhaps all the React and Vue programmers decided to call themselves
something else (or at least their bosses and HR departments reporting
the statistics did). Notice that Web Developers work with "websites" and
not web *applications*. Also, "Digital Designers" look to have been
combined into the "Web Developer" category. My bet is if you can call
what you do an application at all you switch over to Software Developers
--- especially with Electron being used --- and that "Web Designer" (the
title from the best book on the topic) was just not enough umph to get
people to use it in such a study. But if you look at the income levels,
you seen that "Web Developer" really means "Web Designer".
