# Capitalize acronyms in Go: `NodeID` not `NodeId`

One of my biggest pet peeves with people who think they know Go coming from other languages is the demented practice of not capitalizing all of the letters of an acronym. Recently, I had to look this up again because so many people do it wrongly. It's `ID` not `Id`, ever. I don't care if it doesn't translate directly from other case styles, that's the *correct* way to do it in Go. If you force your team to do it any other way that is your prerogative, but *you are doing it wrong!*

I guess I just sick and tired of having to justify this shit to people unfamiliar with Go, who also don't know what a labeled block is, for example.
