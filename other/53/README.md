# Aren't you afraid someone will see what you type?

Nope. Because I can turn it off why holding a hot key combination rather
easily. I use both the left and right control keys. I also have `keyon`
and `keyoff` commands to kill the `screenkey` process just in case. I've
been doing this a while at this point and kinda just know. I can also
hide my screen with `control-u` when needed quickly (by changing the
OBS view).
