# 200 words maximum for KEG/Web site descriptions

Just reading that at least one enterprise search engine limits the HTML/HTTP description to 200 words and that if one is not provided it is extracted from the home page itself. Definitely, want to include that limitation in the docs and spec for KEG (in the `keg` YAML file).
