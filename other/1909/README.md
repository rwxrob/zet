# Damn, are all these commit going to annoy everyone?

Yesterday someone on my Twitch stream commented about the "interesting" commits referring to the ones calling out those idiots creating web sites that depend entirely on JavaScript. It is true that all of this goes onto my permanent record, so to speak. I really don't care, it's true. And when I change my mind about something I'm equally as open about it. But I *do* care about annoying everyone who might be following me on GitHub.

The question is really related to the zet posts that I make. Every time I commit a change to a thought in my zet it shows up in my GitHub feed, and since I do a lot of those (per hour, sometimes) I do wonder about that. If I setup `keg`  to publish to the KEG Web site and not to GitHub that would reduce the amount of annoying notifications from GitHub.

I guess I need to figure out just want some can do to filter out very verbose people on GitHub. And, honestly, I think removing the notifications from GitHub would remove yet another way that people can follow what a person is doing. So, at least for now, I'll just be okay with it.
