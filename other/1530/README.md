# Come to Think of It, I Read the UNIX Dictionary

That's actually how I learned. My first book was 'UNIX in a Nutshell'
and I read it cover to cover even though it was a desktop reference
guide. I lived in that book for years. The more I get into writing the
badges for what I'm now calling the *Linux Beginner Boost*, the more I
find myself listing out individual commands. When I start to fret about
how many there are, I remembered my start with my first book, so I'm all
good.
