ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/jPq643BivY0>

* `microk8s` is *not* Kubernetes
* `minikube` is *not* Kubernetes
* `microk8s` is primarily for real deployments on "edge" devices
* `minikube` is primarily for testing local stuff
* `minikube` automatically forward LoadBalancer
* Best way to learn is on actual hardware
  * Mac Minis (left over)
  * MSI Tridents (left over)
  * Raspberry Pis (left over)
  * Learn infrastructure operations and setup as well
  * Look for old hardware at relatives and friends
