# Local First Content Management

Today our Internet was out almost the entire day and yet I didn't lose a
single bit of productivity. Why? Because all my content is in localized
Git repos and container images that have been cached locally. I used to
tell a story about all the work I got done on the airplane by using Git
repos, but cached container images take this to a whole new level. I
could literally get on my bike, ride up into the mountains, and get shit
done all day while enjoying the great outdoors. None of that is possible
with 100% cloud-based "solutions" such as these fucking brain-dead
"cloud programming" options like REPL.it and others. How stupid do these
people have to be to assume you *always* have an Internet connection ---
and more importantly --- that your customers and users must have a
*good* Internet connection to use your service, and yet this shit gets
funded constantly by bullshit VCs looking for a quick buck with zero
clue.
