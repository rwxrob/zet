# SSH to Local Windows PowerShell Gives Admin

One huge advantage of `ssh`-ing into the Windows half of my WSL2 enabled
system from Linux is that I don't have to leave my TMUX session and
that my connected PowerShell session gets admin perms automatically so I
don't have to fight with opening a separate terminal "As Administrator".
