# TODO: Stream Start Notify Command (Discord, Twitter, Twitch)

Need to make a command that will look at the current or next calendar
entry from a specified, exported Google calendar and send a notification
to Discord with the title and description text as well as a tweet and
even update the current title, category, and tags of the stream. Once it
is working, then I can make a mobile app that does everything by just
pushing a button since the calendar has already been updated with all
the data everyone needs. 

I could make it automated and just make sure that the calendar is always
updated. (It would be horrible to have a notification go out on
something that didn't actually happen.) I could just have a basic
service poll the calendar every 15 minutes and see if the entry has
changed and if so send out the notifications automatically. If I do that
the only thing I have to focus on is updating the calendar, which I do
anyway now as a matter of historical log as well to see what happened
when. Eventually, I'll get good enough to have the calendar entries
automatically update their descriptions with links to the YouTube video
that goes with it.
