# 100% Viewer Sponsored and Supported

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/AXPw0DXSEZk>

*  I want my conclusions and opinions to be based on merit
*  I am not paid to shill, in any way (even though seems like it)
*  Any money I receive from this stream and videos is from viewers
*  I receive most money from GitHub sponsors and Twitch
*  I have Patron but receive very little
*  YouTube pays next to nothing for views
*  I am employed full time by a company I cannot disclose
*  My employer is not primarily a tech company
*  My employer influences my knowledge but does not sponsor me
*  I love John Deere hats but have nothing to do with them
*  I love my Coros watch but am not advertising
*  I turned down a free keyboard
*  I turned down an invite to discuss Linode sponsorship
*  I decided not to apply for Digital Ocean sponsorship
*  I turned down Azure sponsorship
*  I am not against sponsorships
*  I monetize on YouTube and Twitch to get broader exposure
*  YouTube and Twitch algorithms require monetization to be seen
