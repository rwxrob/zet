You can determine everything you need to know about the authority and
experience of the person ranting against the defacto language of the
cloud-native industry by the domain all by itself, and, you guessed it,
it's a Rust moron making the claims. The author clearly wouldn't even
know who Ken Thompson and Rob Pike even are, let alone have any actual
sense when it comes to enterprise software language design.

For a bonus laugh, read all the "informed" comments and remember these
are the same people who take valuable time from their days to rant on
tumblr and reddit and answer "Which language do you love the most?"
idiotic surveys on Stack Exchange.

The writer gives up his JavaScript script-kiddy roots when complaining
about Go's concurrency model after clearly been raised on the fucking
moronic async/await model of JS that Rust also followed (finally, after
they decided to add it to the language about three years after, unlike
Go where it was a first-class consideration from the start).
