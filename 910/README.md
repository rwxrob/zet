# Concerned About Bloat from Figures and Files

I noticed that a simple raster image figure is about ten times larger
than a text zettel. That's not much, but it adds up fast. 

I'm glad I kept the term 'figure' because that is exactly what these
are. They are needed to illustrate something that cannot be explained
with words. That's it. 

While some people might choose to use their ZettelRepo for image and
file storage that was never the original intent. I need to make sure to
warn against that up front.

Thankfully it is trivial to migrate out any and all figures simply into
their own separate ZettelRepo if and when that is needed. 

Once again the nature of a zettel, an extension of the UNIX philosophy,
saves the day. Stuff is already broken out in ways that can easily be
organized and managed. It's easy to migrate not just figures but
anything that matches a complex search query.
