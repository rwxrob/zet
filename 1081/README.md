It could be that the "object" term comes from the fact that Kubernetes
is primarily a REST API and each of these resources (normally thought of
as being contained in a YAML manifest file) are actually REST *objects*
first and foremost. This would explain the confusing use of both
"resource" and "object" when referring to a thing in Kubernetes.
