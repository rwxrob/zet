# Optimal Sound Levels for Streaming

After two years of making videos and streaming, and having others
confirm my conclusions, here are the best sound volume levels for
everything on my PopOS system with the sound mixer board plugged into
the front microphone jack (and receiving from the front headphone jack):

* Desktop Audio: -25dB
* Music: -20%

All the dials on my Yamaha MG10XU are at their default positions except
for a little EQ on the voice mic.
