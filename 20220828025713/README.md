# Learn netplan for Linux Networking

modern Linux. So glad I'm working on this enterprise home lab to catch
up with all these great changes. Just after discovering the amazing
`nmcli` I realized that it isn't even needed on the base install of
Ubuntu Server (which makes me love Ubuntu even more than before,
compared to Red Hat).
