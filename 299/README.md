# Being on WSL2 Makes Me Make Better Scripts

By being on WSL2 I'm forced to think how my scripts would be run on WSL2
(sometimes calling `exe` equivalents of things that are available on Mac
and Linux, like `vmrun`). This is making all my code much better and
prepared for use by those working for large organization where only Mac
and Windows are the options for workstations. The move to WSL2 Linux has
already born fruit. Some would call this annoyance, I call this a great
opportunity to write cross-platform code.
