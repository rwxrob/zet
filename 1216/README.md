# So Many "Educational Review" Articles Lie to You

Just doing a casual search earlier today and found something called
TangoLearn and its *10 Top Kubernetes Online Courses for 2021-22*,
which is absolute shit. The give away is the disclaimer on the bottom of
the page:

> **Disclaimer:** When you buy through some links on our site, we may
> earn a commission. However this commission will not cost you anything
> extra. [The lack of comma after "however" is their omission, not
> mine.]

"Not cost you anything" must not include your time filtering out the
profiteering, shilling assholes from people who actually want to help
you. It's no surprise to anyone that not a single resource listed is
available for free online. Every fucking one of them is on a paid
"training" platform, mostly Udemy and Coursera. 

Even though they state at the bottom of the page that this list has been
reviewed "by 10 Kubernetes experts" (who they do not dare to name for us
to confirm) I can personally confirm that the top Udemy stuff from
Mumshad Mannambeth is absolute shit. I know because I started going
through it and was so disgusted at the focus on flash over substance,
the idiotic design, and just flat-out lack of actual understanding of
modern systems administration and infrastructure that I got a refund
after the first 10 days. I *really* wanted to like it. I did.

The fact that so many have completed this "course" and think they are
prepared for the immense task of infrastructure engineering a Kubernetes
cluster is horrifying. No wonder good companies are hiring senior people
with solid Linux system administration and SRE skills and helping them
upskill using *real* methods instead of these shitty courses. My
contract recruiter just reached out to me today practically begging me
to send *anyone* with good Linux skills to him. He wants people who are
true autodidacts, who have largely learned on their own through
experimentation and shadowing people who are already paid to do this
sort of work.

The simple reality is that the more flashy something is --- and the more a
person focuses *only* on "teaching" something --- the less likely the
content is going to be worth learning. This is nothing new. It's been
true since humans started learning. But there is always some asshole
lying to you to sell you a quick-n-easy "course". 

Mentoring is so much more valuable than any "course" you could
ever find. Pairing and shadowing experienced professionals has been how
learning UNIX/Linux has been done for decades, and Kubernetes is
literally just an extension of that. Mentoring is the only way to
go. Give mentors and those learning a road map and the resources
to do their own learning. Vocational training and Scouting has been done
this way for decades.

Creating an *open* credential merit system would address these issues,
one that is not driven by affiliate links, hidden profits, and
"teachers" and "trainers" trying to convince you they know what the fuck
they are talking about by adding yet another animation to their
presentation rather than actually working at all with the technology,
you know, building their own *real* experience and sharing it in an
organized way.
