# Evolution of Privacy

"Those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little
temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety" (Ben Franklin)

"Y'all need to read The Transparent Society by David Brin. His contention
is that privacy will disappear, but when it does, we need to make sure
the whole system is transparent -- so that we can see inside the halls
of power as well as them seeing us." (green_jenny)
