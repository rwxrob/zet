# Content Organization and Locations

I have got content all over the place currently and need to get better
and deciding a final form and location for it as well as where to dump
it and manage it while I am creating it. This includes video, audio, and
illustration content in addition to all the written stuff. I figure the
final form is one of the following types:

* Book (Digital)
* Progressive Web App
* Zettelkasten / KEG Node
* Software Package
* Scripts Repository
* YouTube

I already have some specific ones:

* rwxrob.live (community)
* rwxrob.tv (community)
* rwx.gg (PWA with Boost and badges)
* skilstak.io (PWA with CYOA / Easter eggs)
* Zettelkasten, Private
