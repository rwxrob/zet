# Grepping `#AMA` from IRC Chat Logs FTW!

I'm reminded how superior the UNIX approach is to all things from just a
simple need that was immediately met just by doing the right thing the
whole time. I've been using IRC to connect to Twitch from the very
beginning and always keeping logs of everything said in any chat. Keep
in mind that if you use just the Twitch web UI you can't see past stuff
that goes back any length of time. I have a record of all of it. And I
save that record in a private git repo. So when it occurred to me that
allowing people to put `#AMA` into their messages to have them
automatically filtered into a list that I can not only grep but
immediately put into a document --- dynamically --- I was one very happy
streamer. No bot to build. No code at all, for now. And when code is
needed a few lines of bash will do the trick. That's why the UNIX
approach will always win over the shit people do with bots and other
approaches. You don't need a fucking bot. You need an IRC client with a
log. That's all.
