# More ISOSEC Identifier in My Zettelkasten

Turns out using an isosec identifier is a problem because there is no
indication of what that node is about, nor is there any promise that the
time of the isosec has any relevance. Instead, I'll be forcing myself to
create actual names that match the titles and deprecating or deleting or
redirecting when that title changes. This is what I did for several
years before the latest iteration of my zet design. I felt having the
names free to change was best.

Strictly speaking, there is nothing in the KEG specification that
prevents others from using isosec if they wish.
