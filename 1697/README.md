# I love "PKM specialists" who use slugs and fail to understand

Just searching for the "personal knowledge management" term to decide how much of it I want to refer to in my KEG documentation. (KEG is much more than just a PKG, although it *is* a PKG.) Every single blog and articles uses broken URLs with slugs in them, the exact things that the creator of the WorldWideWeb directly warned against almost a decade ago. It's just so ironic that these "experts" who are selling Udemy courses and books don't even have the basic understanding of data and information systems management to see why this is so fucking broken (and always has been). It's also telling that they haven't bothered to even read Tim's book to learn from the successes and failures of the Web. These people also profess to be "knowledge specialists" and don't even do minimal research into the topic before producing content to sell to others. I'm sure I'm guilty of the same thing. It motivates me to be sure to *not* do this again.
