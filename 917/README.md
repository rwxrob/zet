# Tempted to Do All the KodeKloud Stuff

I've heard really good things about KodeKloud and feel like I need to
take some of my streaming income budget and just do all the Kubernetes
stuff on stream. We can glean out the main points and eventually massage
them into foundational material for the Beginner Boost as well as other
Cloud Native Boost (if I ever get to that one, just keeping up with the
annual changes for a single Boost is hard enough).

In fact, I'm thinking of cramming through all of these Before end of
July so I can get my certs (or at least try the test twice) and report
on that. I have three certs to do, and my k8s knowledge continues to
wane while working on other stuff at work and at home. But, the
https://killer.sh stuff covers how to setup all this stuff at home,
which I think is by far the most important. I Just need to dedicate more
specific time to that on the schedule. In fact, I'm going to write it in
on Sundays on the Twitch schedule.
