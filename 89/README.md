# People I Fantasize About

I actually have dreams about sitting around a table just conversing with
these people. I know that sounds weird, 'cuz I am weird.

* Linus Torvalds
* Steve Wozniak
* Aaron Swartz
* Lawrence Lessing
* Donald Knuth
* John MacFarlane
* TJ Holowaychuk
* Rob Pike
* Ken Thompson
* Alan Turing
* Dennis Ritchie
* Brian Kernighan
* Larry Wall
* Doug McIlroy
* John McCarthy
* Niklas Luhmann

This does not include people I find even more influential, but I just
would not give a shit about having a coffee with them:

* Richard Stallman
* Chomsky
