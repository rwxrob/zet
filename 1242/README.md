# Replace Twitch Tags with API

One of the hardest things to keep up to date now that I'm streaming in
all sorts of categories (which I hear they call "variety streaming") it
is really hard to change all the meta data to keep people less annoyed
when they get a notification about my stream that might be less than
accurate).

The problem with variety streaming is that finding the right tags takes
a lot of energy to do every time. For example, I love the *co-working*
tag (that members of the community lobbied Twitch to add) but it would
be completely wrong to have that during one of my outdoor runs. Someone
filtering out all *co-working* streams would be pissed if they ran
across mine.

I need to make a PWA that allows the combination of things that I want
to change based on what is immediately happening, and to make so that I
just have to press a button to make it happen. In fact, I am realizing I
really need an app for lots of stuff with buttons I can just tap from my
phone.
