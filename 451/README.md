# Similarities to and Influence of Scouting Program

I keep getting called back cognitively to my roots helping people gain
the rank of Eagle in the Boy Scout program. I'm no longer a Scout Master
(and have significant issues with the program as a whole preventing me
from ever returning to it) but the system created in 1910 for Merit
Badges and ranks holds tremendous value for me as I consider the goals
for the Beginner Boost:

* Solidify life-long autodidact habits
* Minimize impact and dependency on volunteer subject matter experts
* Foster feeling of control and progressive confidence
* Exposure to possibilities perhaps not yet considered
* Keep learning engaging through gamified achievements
* Easily navigated without feeling lost
* Consistent and regularly reviewed for relevance
* Well-defined, testable requirements

These are the same goals the Scouting program has always had.

There's a solid reason putting "Eagle Scout" on your resume (or at least
there was). It's a venerable mark of excellence. It conveys much
about the character, drive, and ability of the person who earns it (not
just of the parents forcing their kid to get it.)

I feel like an equivalent that embraces the modern era is really missing
in our world today, a system or program that focuses on technology and
autodidactic learning at its core. Why not build on something that has
already been proven to work for over a century?
