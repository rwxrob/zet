# Books I want to write

I've always been a fan of books even though technical books regularly
suffer from falling out of date. Books are *still*  a better
comprehensive resource than wikis because they are written with a
consistent voice and reader in mind and are (usually) edited better.

That said, the books I write will always be free online with paper
equivalents in print (like No Starch Press).

### General Technology

This category of books contains stuff of general interest and import to
most technologists. Focus is on practices, habits, and knowledge rather
than specific technologies.

* Terminal Velocity: Mastering the Fastest Human-Computer Interface
* Autodidactic: How to Succeed as a Knowledge Worker
* Good to Gig: Surviving the Radical New Sharing Economy
* Works for Me: Modern Collaborative Developer Practices
* Coding for Self-Empowerment: Programming with Purpose
* SKILSTAK: Learning How to Help Others Learn
* PEGN: Parsing Expression Grammar Notation
* Bonzai: Building Stateful Command Tree Interfaces with Go
* Knowledge Exchange Graphs: Manage Knowledge Like Software (or Booze)
