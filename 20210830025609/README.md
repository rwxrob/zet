# Beginner Boost: Before You Begin

This is the "you must be this tall to ride this ride" warning in the
front of the line to one of the most amazing rides you will ever
experience. If you're not yet this "tall" then wait until you are, or
take some proverbial growth hormones. There's nothing stopping you from
going on this ride even if you aren't "tall" enough, but you might end
up getting whiplash, puking all over your family, or getting violently
thrown from the ride and decapitated. That's on you. You've been warned.

Do not proceed unless you have met all the following requirements:

* You have access to an *actual* computer (no iPads, etc.)
* You have permission to install stuff onto that computer
* You could wipe the computer completely blank and be okay
* You can type at least 30 words a minute *from home row*
* You are willing and able to do *a lot* of reading
* You are willing to take responsibility for your own learning
* You are committed to sharing (not hording) your knowledge
* You will never make someone feel small for knowing less
* You can do basic algebraic linear equations
* You can articulate what a *function* is in mathematics
* You regularly ask "why" and "how" about everything and anything
* You can explain and use the scientific method
* You have never once believed the Earth is flat or Cthulhu is real

And if you are attending the Boost in person:

* You have been immunized
* You are not experiencing any symptoms of sickness
* You take regular showers and care for your personal hygiene
