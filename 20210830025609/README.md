# Beginner Boost: Before You Begin

This is the "you must be this tall to ride this ride" warning in the
front of the line to one of the most amazing rides you will ever
experience. If you're not yet this "tall" then wait until you are, or
take some proverbial growth hormones. There's nothing stopping you from
going on this ride even if you aren't "tall" enough, but you might end
up getting whiplash, puking all over your family, or getting violently
thrown from the ride and decapitated. That's on you. You've been warned.

Do not proceed unless you have met all the following requirements:

* You can dedicate six hours per week to learning, minimum
* You have full access to an *actual* computer (no iPads, etc.)
* You have permission to install stuff onto the computer
* You can delete everything on the computer and no one will care
* You can type at least 30 words a minute *from home row*
* You are willing and able to do *a lot* of reading
* You are capable of reading and understanding Harry Potter
* You are 13 years old or older (required by most services)
* You are capable of remembering and managing your passwords
* You have an email account that you fully control
* You can easily do basic algebraic linear equations
* You can articulate what a *function* is in mathematics
* You regularly ask "why" and "how" about everything and anything
* You can explain and use the scientific method
* You are willing to take responsibility for your own learning
* You are committed to sharing (not hording) your knowledge
* You will never make someone feel small for knowing less than you

And if you are attending the Boost in person:

* You have been immunized
* You are not experiencing any symptoms of sickness
* You take regular showers and care for your personal hygiene
* You will be punctual (10 minutes late is automatic cancellation)
