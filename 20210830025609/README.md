# Boost: You Must Be This 'Tall' to Ride

* Describe what the Beginner Boost is
* Understand your part and participation in the Boost
* Know what is required of yourself
* Be aware of the risks
* Willingly accept these requirements before continuing

Imagine yourself standing with your friends in the lobby of an enticing
"ride" at your favorite amusement park where all you do is learn to
escape from one room to the next, with no limits (well none but those
you see written on the wall in this lobby room). You scan the wall with
your friends and make sure you are all, metaphorically speaking, "tall
enough" to ride this ride:

* You know what the Beginner Boost is and how it works
* You can dedicate six hours per week to learning, minimum
* You have full access to an *actual* computer (no iPads, etc.)
* You have permission to install stuff onto the computer
* You can delete everything on the computer and no one will care
* You can type at least 30 words a minute *from home row*
* You are willing and able to do *a lot* of reading
* You are capable of reading and understanding Harry Potter
* You are 13 years old or older (required by most services)
* You are capable of remembering and managing your passwords
* You have an email account that you fully control
* You can easily do basic algebraic linear equations
* You can articulate what a *function* is in mathematics
* You regularly ask "why" and "how" about everything and anything
* You can explain and use the scientific method
* You are willing to take responsibility for your own learning
* You are committed to sharing (not hording) your knowledge
* You will never make someone feel small for knowing less than you

And if you are physically doing the Boost in person (in an *actual*
room with others):

* You have been immunized
* You are not experiencing any symptoms of sickness
* You take regular showers and care for your personal hygiene
* You will be punctual (10 minutes late is automatic cancellation)
