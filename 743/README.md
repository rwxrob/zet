# Carl Sagan Predicts Future 25 Years Ago

I cannot overstate my agreement with what Sagan predicted. Don't get
sad, get busy.

> I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's
> time --- when the United States is a service and information economy;
> when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to
> other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of
> a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp
> the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own
> agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching
> our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical
> faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good
> and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into
> superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident
> in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential
> media, the 30 second sound bits (now down to 10 seconds or less),
> lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on
> pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration
> of ignorance. (Carl Sagan, "The Demon-Haunted World" 1995)
