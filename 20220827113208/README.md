# Use nmcli to Manage Network on Modern Linux

One of the things I need to catch up on is use of `nmcli` to manage
everything about the network interfaces on Linux machines. All the old
`ifconfig` stuff is really old.

Note that this does not come by default on Ubuntu Server so will have to
be installed.

```
sudo apt install -y network-manager
```
