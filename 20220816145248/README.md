# Cloud or Home Lab Server?

In 2022 it makes the most sense for people like me doing operations and
security work to simply start with a good server in their home lab with
multiple cores that can be allocated to different virtual machines
easily. Old, refurbished hardware can be added as you go.

But what if you don't have the money, room, or power to buy a 32 core
home lab server? What about cloud?

After a bit of comparison shopping a 32 core, 128GiB server costs about
as much as 2 years of cloud services for a dedicated server of the same
size (on Contabo, for example). This means that going with cloud will be
less money and hassle for most people wanting to do this stuff.

Cloud does have some disadvantages, for example, how do you practice
setting up NFS or storage classes in cloud when they do all that for you
in advance?

I think I'm going with cloud for now so I can live out of my car and
still be productive.
