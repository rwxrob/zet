# Get Used to Reading Docs Like on Kubernetes Exam

* Use Chrome or Chromium since works better
* Use graphics for better visual mnemonic queues
* Get good searching for things quickly
* Remember you only get *two tabs* (one for exam, other for docs)
* Especially practice if you rarely use GUI browser
* Turn Vimium Off (at least for allowed doc sites)
* Stick with 100% scale so stuff doesn't move around
* Get good with searching
