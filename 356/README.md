# Preparing, Programming, Projects, Professional

Learning requires different levels of attention at different stages. At
first, people tend to need more guidance and encouragement while they
develop their sense of confidence and trust themselves to know how to
learning what they need on their own. For more than 10 years while
observing hundreds of SKILSTAK learning community members I've come to
recognize these stages the following (with names that are easy to
remember):

1. Preparing
1. Programming
1. Projects
1. Professional

Learning begins with *preparing* the fundamental skills and a platform
on which to learn *programming* that will eventually enable you to
develop your own *projects* that prove your capabilities as a
*professional* to potential employers.
