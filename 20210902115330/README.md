# ZettelMark: Terms

A ***term*** is a word that occurs within a zettel (usually near the
beginning) that might need some definition, a good candidate for a
glossary. In ZettelMark terms are marked up with triple asterisk
(`***term***`), which is rendered as bold-italic in GitHub Flavored
Markdown. This leaves the rhetoric style emphases, italic and bold,
untouched and available to authors while giving a very strong indication
of terms that should be remembered to the reader. This markup also
allows terms to be automatically parsed from the content with very
little difficulty without incurring the overhead and incompatibility of
a non-standard markup method.
