# Learn Using Real Tech, Not Simulations

You do not know Kubernetes until you have installed it on your
machine(s). Kind (or minikube if you insist) can get you started, but
eventually, you really should foot the bill for some Raspberry Pis, or
cloud systems, perhaps even a NAS device (which every enterprise K8s
cluster will usually use). Even though the certification exam requires a
web browser emulating a terminal, you won't be using that in the field.
Learn what you will be using professionally.
