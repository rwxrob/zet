# Feeling Pulled Away from Go Toward Bash

I am constantly being pulled between my two favorite get-shit-done
languages, Go and Bash. In fact, I did all of my knowledge base
management system in Bash and had it all working in 2016 and then ripped
it apart and started doing it all in Go, for whatever reason. It was
working just fine in Bash but I wanted it to be "production" or some
shit. Well I don't feel that way today. I got shit to do. If Bash gets
it done, I'm good.

I did all of CmdBox to make it easier to, um, create (essentially) shell
script utilities in Go. But why not just keep them in Bash? 

Bash is definitely not something you would release a major product in,
for lots of reasons, that is what Go is specifically for, but how much
of this shit is ever going to end up in a product. And if and when it
does all that Bash has ironed out the usage issues and user interface.
All the hard work will have already been done and matured. Then you just
port it all to Go and you're good. Before that who really gives a shit
about strict typing. It just works. That is *literally* the UNIX
philosophy mantra.
