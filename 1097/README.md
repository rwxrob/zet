# Learn a "Hard" Language First, Like C

You might want to consider learning a "hard" language (I suggest C)
before an easy one (like Python or JavaScript). It will take you longer,
but you'll understand how computers and languages work better and be a
better developer and engineer for it in the long run.

Python and JavaScript can create some serious bad developer habits ---
especially in beginners and introduce them to things like
object-oriented programming way before it is relevant.

OOP (and other paradigms) are there to make it easier to handle complex
code with lots of parts. Paradigms are a way to translate this
complexity into a form humans can understand. There is raging academic
debate about which paradigm is better for what purpose. But the entire
paradigms thing is pre-mature learning for someone just beginning to
understand how computers work and how to make them do what they want.
This is why I now believe POSIX shell and C, technically both
"imperative" languages are the best first languages most should learn.
