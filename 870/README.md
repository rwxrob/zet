# Boost Badges

Boost badges are OCMS credentials that were originally designed to
contain all the learning available from the rwxrob.tv Beginner Boost in
an organized, achievable, gamified way. The concept and name "Boost
Badge" have since been opened to encompass any learning content composed
into this format.

Even though the content of each badge is different, the breadth and
depth of coverage is similar. The requirements and options are all
outlined and meant to be measurable and easily self-assessed. Anyone
reading the requirements outlined should get a quick sense of how much
work they are going to have to put in to learn it, personally. Everyone
learns at different rates and has different priorities to work with in
life. Taking on the task of earning a badge is, therefore, a personal
decision with no forced schedule or agenda.

The content of any particular badge might have been originally created
by a single person, but the hope is that badges will be maintained in an
open way such that people can contribute their ideas for content and
potential changes in a versioned way. Each badge, therefore, has its own
Git repo and primary maintainer. (See the `template-badge` repo
for more.)
