# Q: What's the best way to learn POSIX shell?

📺 <https://youtu.be/H1eE1q9IoWc>

First of all, I no longer believe you should *first* learn POSIX shell
for the following reasons:

1. `shellcheck` exists, when I need POSIX I can check
1. bash is the default on most server Linux systems
1. Usually I'm not being *forced* to do POSIX

***PSA: You do NOT need `sed` and `awk` and `tr` as much as you
think!*** (Because even POSIX shell has parameter expansion.)
