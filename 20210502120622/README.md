# Rob's Personal Code of Conduct

I know I fail miserably to keep it. But having it written down helps me
remember. Often I have to repeat these to myself over and over again to
help remember in the heat of the moment. Obviously, this is not an
exhaustive list, but it sure helps.

* Chill out!
* Swear better.
* Foster dialog.
* Live with less.
* Let people change.
* Read the fancy manual.
* Take stock of successes.
* Don't get mad, get busy. 
* What if everybody did it?
* Create, don't just consume.
* Give the benefit of the doubt.
* Build something useful, not clever.
* Show and share, don't teach and preach.
* Go outside. Remind your body you're human.

And here's when I know I'm being evil:

* ~~What can I get away with?~~
* ~~Assume malintent.~~
* ~~Chase the likes.~~
