# KEG Zettelkasten for Muhlestein, Robert S. (rwxrob)

Everything is in [`docs`](docs/dex) or at <https://rwxrob.github.io/zet>. Note that the nature of a Zettelkasten is to be messy and unedited full of information that might once have been relevant or true and now no longer is. Failure to keep this in mind when reading a person's Zettelkasten can give a false impression of their current position on any topic whatsoever.
