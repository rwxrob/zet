# KEG Zettelkasten for Muhlestein, Robert S. (rwxrob)

Everything is in [`docs`](docs/dex) or at <https://rwxrob.github.io/zet>. Note that the nature of a Zettelkasten is to be messy and unedited full of information that might once have been relevant or true or written in a moment of passion and now is no longer how I feel or even completely inaccurate. This is not a "blog" or "site" or publication of any kind. Failure to keep this in mind when reading *any* zettelkasten can result in harm to me and others. *Never* cite anything from this or any other zettelkasten. Instead, use it to inspire your own research and conclusions.

***NOTICE: This is not "open" content. It is illegal to copy anything from this zettelkasten for any other purpose whatsoever that is not guaranteed under American "fair use" copyright law. Violators will be prosecuted. This is to protect myself from people straight-up lying about me and my current position on any topic based on what is here. I'm very serious about prosecution. I will find you and ensure you receive consequences if you abuse this content and misrepresent me in any way.***
