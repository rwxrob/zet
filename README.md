# Personal Zettelkasten of `@rwxrob`

Hi I'm Rob Muhlestein from http://rwxrob.tv. This is my personal, public
Zettelkasten repository. It contains stuff on pretty much any topic
I feel like writing about, that I'm good with being public. I'm a very
public person because I sincerely want to help others find their own
path. There are tons of spelling and grammar errors and opinions and
mistakes and realizations I was wrong because it is meant to be an
organic place to dump thoughts, not a final publication (although the
idea is to use a Zettelkasten to produce such things).

I want people to find value in this content *as is*, just don't change
it and abuse it. Citations and quoting with attribution are 100% okay
under fair-use copyright laws everywhere. Forking is okay as long as
you make no public changes to your fork (which would be 'derivative
works'). If you see an error, submit an issue. Don't submit a PR
(since technically a PR is illegal under 'no derivatives' clause).
