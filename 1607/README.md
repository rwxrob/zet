# Twitch VOD Descriptions are SHIT!

I'm so fucking tired of how shitty the interface is for changing Twitch
descriptions. If fucks up the Markdown rendering every time and does not
give you the option to just use plain text. Then, when you export, the
exports fail silently to YouTube because there are compatibility issues.

The answer is to not even use the fucking thing. To just use an API to
set the description to the Twitch videos and to the YouTube video and to
keep them in sync, except I have to fucking write it every time because
there is no shitty app to even attempt it.

The fact of the matter is that I really don't give a shit about the
Twitch VOD anyway. Their search engine is shit and anyone who keeps
anything posts that to YouTube which pulls up in Google searches. I
don't even want Twitch highlight VODs to show up at all. It's just like
a backup of the video content itself. So from now on, the Twitch VOD
description will just be empty and I'll tie the YouTube description to
an zet like I did before and I already have the code for that. Sounds
like a weekend or night project.
