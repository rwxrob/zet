# Commit `zet` Fails Unless GPG Passphrase Cached

I noticed that my `zet` command failed because I was using GPG signing
and had just installed a new system and not yet signed anything thereby
being prompted to enter the passphrase for the GPG key. I believe this
is only required once to first use the key, but I'll keep watching it.
