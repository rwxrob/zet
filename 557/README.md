# JSON5 is a Fucking Horrible Idea

The people that conceived of JSON5 have no fucking clue how JSON should
be used and how it should be used and specified. Just look at the other
"projects" created by its creator. They speak for themselves. There's a
very important reason Crockford left out the things he did. But the
JSON5 proponents really just don't get it. I hope JSON5 dies the
horrible death it deserves. Putting your name anywhere near that
project just proves how fucking uninformed and incompetent you are.

I'll give you a hint: JSON is *not* for humans, gawd-damnit, it's
primarily for quick transfer and parsing by *applications.* It is the
most efficient parsable text content that remains minimally human
readable. It is *not* for configuration files that humans manipulate
(even though the entire fucking world of idiot devs seems to think
otherwise).

Thank God people who matter are moving to Protobuf over JSON anyway (and
will even more now that Go 1.18 is out.

This is why I have such a fire under my ass to finish PEGN. PEGN will
give us the ability to very rapidly play with sub-specifications of
other, very useful things like simplified YAML, and Markdown. JSON does
not need further simplification. There are really only two flavors of
JSON, with whitespace and without. Stop fucking with it, you fucking
idiots.
