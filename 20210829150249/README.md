# Value of Zettel Granularity

Because a zettel is, by definition, just one main thought or topic or
concept it is very easy to just remove it if you change or mind or find
that it is no longer relevant. 

I've found that if I have followed the rules for "one best thought" when
writing a zettel that the impact when that thought changes or goes away
is reduced to zero. There's no reworking of the idea, or preservation of
other content in the zettel that might be still relevant. You just
delete it. 

If you have linked to that zettel somehow, that is a concern because the
links will break, but that would have happened anyway, which is why you
should encourage people to link --- not to a specific zettel --- but to
searches of your zettelkasten so that they can find the most recent and
relevant knowledge captured about the topic instead of one specific
thought about it. This is one reason external hyperlinking was always a
bad design.
