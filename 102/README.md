# Seems Fitting to Add `ed` Now That Over 9000

By some act of sheer coincidence I just topped 9002 followers on my
Twitch live stream *and* decided to add `ed` officially to the boost
while learning `vim` so that people can see how it relates to
everything, and so I have a way to introduce regular expressions at the
same time as `bash` scripting. It is no coincidence that my YouTube
concurrent viewership also seriously spiked last night while learning
`ed` live for the first time. People like the one true editor,
apparently.
