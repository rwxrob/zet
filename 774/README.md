# KEGML -> KEG Mark

I was wondering why KEGML sounded good and off at the same time.
Obviously, the letters "m" and "l" have been taken over by "machine
learning" in 2022. HT-ML gets special dispensation, but willingly
putting ML into your acronym these days is a just asking for confusion.

Also, the term "Markdown" is technically the legal trademark of Gruber
and Swartz who created the term to take a stab at HTML. That is why
CommonMark and GoldMark don't have Markdown in the name.
