# Dropped Legal Stuff from `help.Cmd`

I realized that although it is good to have legal information in each of
the different Bonzai composable branches, since they are coming from
distinctly different sources, that having my stuff in the `help.Cmd`
could get more confusing than usual since people generally look at the
help information to decide legal information. It's just blank now.
