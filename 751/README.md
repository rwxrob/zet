# Sphynx Sucks, Mostly Because of reST

People keep saying how amazing Python reStructuredText is because of
it's "extensibility" but that is exactly the wrong thing to add to
anything that hopes to be usable by anyone. It's the reason JGM spend so
much effort to arrive at the CommonMark (Markdown) standard.

After reading through the readthedocs documentation I've never been more
fired up to replace the whole damn thing with a simpler, yet more
powerful version of something that builds on the basic idea of
*knowledge nodes* in CommonMark, with the only extension being GitHub
tables and Katex math support. This core content can always been wrapped
in other formatting appropriate for the target audience, with the
primary target user being anyone with a computer or a phone who wants
simple information that is easy to maintain without advance knowledge of
*anything* but Markdown.

Our solution will also have a single executable to install, none of this
Python shit.

Here's another opportunity to follow "don't get mad, get busy" making
something better.
