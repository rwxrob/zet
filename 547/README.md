# Using Twitch as Edtech Application Even AFK

I've stumbled onto a rather remarkable thing about Twitch when combined
with a really good chat bot: people interact with it and learn even when
I'm AFK (usually sleeping or working). Even better, their interactions
with the bot are collaborative. The fact that Twitch uses IRC makes
these even better. People don't even have to use Twitch at all. At that
point, Twitch just becomes an educational, community IRC channel with a
graphic interface and pretty fishies or music or whatever. This makes
Twitch the single best place to produce autonomous, interactive
educational material (or group-driven interactive fiction, for that
matter).

My immediate concern about doing this is all the false notifications
that people will still get about me, potentially causing them to unsub,
but I already have that problem because 95% of my streaming is me
silently working on screen. I think the trade off is worth it --
especially now that there is something to interact with even when I'm
away. People can use Twitch like an interactive, educational story game
of sorts and just try out all the different bot commands (which is even
more reason I need to get my own bot in place that has an educational
community focus, now that is something I could definitely present as
ISTE).
