# "Personal Knowledge Grids" *Yawn*

Just reading about this in a blog this week (which I can't even
remember). I do like the term though, PKG. I guess that makes PKEs
"personal knowledge exchanges" which is what KEG is, of course, and the
Knowledge Net was before that, and the Essential Web was before that.
I've been exploring this area since 2016. But, as I've said recently,
it's not about the idea, it's about the delivery, which is why that
shitty proprietary software (Obsidian) is so fucking popular even though
it thumbs its nose at existing standards and promotes lock-in so you
have to permanently bow down to them for all of your personal knowledge
management. Is there *any* rational person who thinks that is actually a
good idea? I swear, people are so lazy they will use that shit rather
than just a well-organized git repo just because it's so shiny and easy.
But, like I said, it's done. My `keg` Bonzai branch will be so
phenomenally better than Obsidian could ever dream of being, but it
isn't done yet. Just a bunch of good intentions and amazing ideas, with
nothing to show for it. The bright side of it all is that Bonzai is now
very usable and will be at v1.0.0 by August. And without that standard
for modular applications development I never could have proceeded well
with *any* of the other stuff.
