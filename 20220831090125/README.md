# Feels Good to Be Up Early

Managed somehow to get up at 4AM today. The quiet of early morn is
distinct. The entire world seems to sleep, except me. The illusion
is almost hypnotic in its appeal pulling me into thoughts and ideas and
actions that I need. I'm quite sure I have undiagnosed ADHD and this is
just what the proverbial doctor ordered.
