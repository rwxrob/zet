# Git has Tags, But Not Downloadable Releases

Might seem obvious to, um, everyone but me. But I had to look up that
releases are, indeed, a GitHub thing, and not a Git thing. GitHub just
uses Git tagging to create the basis of releases. It makes sense when I
think of it because you have to create a separate release document on
GitHub and there is nothing in Git remotely related to that sort of
thing.
