# Laughing My Ass Off at My Gnome Zoom Profile Picture

Making myself laugh is worth it. Every time I join a formal Zoom meeting
(or any meeting) I get to show off my completely silly gnome profile
pic. It really reveals a lot about the people you are in the call with.
If they don't laugh, I really don't give a shit. I'm so far past having
such a corporate stick up my ass that such things are considered
"inappropriate" and I'm encouraged by the fact that most of the up and
coming tech workforce appreciates informality in the workplace more
more, hell, they are clamouring for "gamification" of everything. When
you work with people who think even logging into Twitch constitutes
a statement of unprofessionalism (all by itself) you just can't win.
After all, I was using IRC at work, despite direct policies against it,
or even use of the Web during "work hours" enough to know that such
people's opinions are worth a shit. In fact, a good shit would be worth
more than their opinions. Very satisfying.

Did that strike you as inappropriate?

My official response is, "Fuck off."

As Mattew Lesko says, "I'm probably not gonna like you either, so we've
just saved each other a ton of time."
