# Postable Boost Learning Rooms

I'm really enjoying the advantages to having shaved this yak so well for
the Beginner Boost stuff. Each ***room*** can easily be posted as is.
People can just enter the room and read it, whether first-timers with
the boost or veterans.

When the map is ready they'll be able to see where the room fits into
the entire MUDL and traverse it however they want. There's nothing
stopping people from jumping around to different rooms and being able to
see how all the rooms (and the learning and skills in those rooms) is
interconnected. It will be simply amazing from a learner's perspective.
It's exactly what I would have wanted when I was learning all of this.
Perhaps the MUDL Model will take off with other content and topics.
