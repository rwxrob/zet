# What If Kubernetes Components Were People?

While listening to Nana on YouTube (who does the best summary of
Kubernetes I've ever heard even though it is very outdated) it
occurred to me that perhaps the best way to memorize how all of this
works is to visualize each of the components as a person with
a personality and role in an IT shop. I plan on working them all out and
doing a fun video acting them out as they do their work. For example,
the `controller-manager` is constantly checking in on everyone else to
make sure they are okay, that nothing has gone wrong, the incessant
micro-manager stopping by the cubicles every five minutes to make sure
there are no blockers and when they see one immediately reports the new
status up the chain to the `schedulers` who are constantly assessing
where resources are being allocated and monitoring for the best place to
start new work leaving the status monitoring to the `managers`. The
`api-servers` are the highly trained receivers of messages conveyed from
everything else, like the sexy, tattooed, phone operators in John Wick.

You get the idea.

I've always been obsessed with role-playing and it to be a powerful
mnemonic device when conveying highly complex systems and interactions,
which makes sense since it is the same type of strategy that competitive
memorization champions use. Our brains remember things they can
visualize and put into terms of human relationships. Our spatial memory
is very powerful, which is why imagining being in a place makes memories
associated with it stick so strongly. For example, I can practically
remember every slope and clearing from the many hours I spent grinding
in World of Warcraft even though that actual place never existed. This
is also why I still maintain that virtual 3d worlds are very powerful
learning technologies.
