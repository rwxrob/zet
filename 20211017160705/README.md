# Q: What do you think about KCNA exam?

* Kubernetes Cloud-Native Associate
* Targeted for everyone to get feel for Kubernetes
* Probably in response to "it's too complicated"
* Multiple-choice exam
* Still plan on CKAD, CKA, CKS if engineer
* I have zero interest in getting it
* Can't hurt to have it
* Don't think it is worth \$250
* Honestly, know one actually knows what will be on it
* Would prefer energy dedicated to improving free resources
* Reason I invented Open Credential Merit System
