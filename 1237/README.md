# Boost: Objectives and Self-Assessment

* Describe what *learning objectives* are
* Be able to find objectives in the content
* Know how to create own objectives
* Feel comfortable assessing yourself

Each ***learning room*** has a set of objectives summarized at the top. You
can confidently move on through one of the ***doors*** after you have
completed all of them.

Objectives are always worded in such as way that that is you can answer
"yes, I can do this" you pass. This helps with self-assessment, which is
itself a skill that takes practice to master. You might consider writing
out your responses or speaking them back to yourself at first to get
used to it.

If you aren't confident, perhaps get a friend or mentor to help you make
that assessment and improve your confidence. You can look for other
people in the same ***room*** with you and work out how to escape that
room with them. Just remember that ultimately you should be just as
skilled as self-assessment as you are any of the skills. 

You are not done with the Boost until you feel 100% confident in your
ability to set forth a learning plan and self-assess completely
independently. Doing this requires the ability to confidently create
learning objectives for yourself. 

These are critical essential skills of any autodidact.
