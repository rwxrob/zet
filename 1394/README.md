# 2023 Boost Will Require Installing Linux on Hardware

After today's Homelab init and QCA it has become clear that even though
there are easier ways to get to a Linux command line, the importance of
knowing how to install Linux on bare-metal hardware is worth the time
and hassle. Without this base ability, all the other Linux skills one
acquires during the boost are limited to creating virtual machines and
working in the cloud. While this is also essential learning, it is
secondary to learning to deal with Linux on-prem in a home lab. Plus,
this sets the ground-work for building a more robust home lab network of
systems later, including the hassles of doing so that are only learned
by dealing with actual hardware, like BIOS manipulation, burning USB
images, mounting storage, and setting up a home network safely.
