# Modal Living FTW!

> deyloop: rob has transitioned from modal text editing to modal living

Using a modal editor like Vi/m has really shaped the way I view the
world, but that wasn't the only influence. The Kubernetes tool `kubectl`
does the same thing with "contexts". Rather than dealing with a bunch of
complicated arguments, you change between modes that have those
arguments associated with what is effectively a state or mode.

This is the same idea behind the `cmdbox` stuff as well. By creating
configurations of different states, we change between them more easily
and can preserve the stuff we use regularly rather than memorizing all
the arguments or hard coding them into scripts.
