# Rant: It's Not 'Google Go', It's Go, Moron

I am so fucking sick and tired of reading, often from people who know
better, the 'Google Go' thing. Go has not been directly under Google for
almost a decade at this point. So when I see an enthusiastic team of
excited noobs, in one of the largest companies on planet Earth,
*finally* create a 'center of excellence' focused on the 'Google Go'
language (with only a few dozen members out of thousands) I want to
fucking punch someone, not joining their fucking 'Idea Party'. 

Here's an idea: get a fucking clue!

Go has been around for longer than some of your children are old and you
finally got around to thinking this 'new' language is something this
gigantic company, with millions invested in 'HPC Machine Learning
Cloud', *might* be able to 'ideate' into something interesting. \*sigh\*
