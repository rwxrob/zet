# Preserve Your Knowledge in GitHub Arctic Vault

Putting content into GitHub could well mean that your knowledge is
permanently saved as a part of The Arctic Project. That reason alone is
compelling enough to put my writing no where else on Earth. In fact, I
could pitch a presentation about this to GitHub. I don't think GitHub
has adequately ceased on this notion of knowledge archival and how
critically important to humanity that could prove to be. It also further
motivates me to promote nothing else.
