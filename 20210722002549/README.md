# How Do You Feel About Docker vs Podman?

1. I think it is a lie to say podman is "daemon-less"?
1. I actually like that there is a daemon that is independent
1. I don't like being forced to use systemd
1. You cannot run podman on non-systemd systems
1. I just don't like RedHat (lately)
1. I detest OpenShift, I hope it dies
1. There is no equivalent to Docker Desktop in podman
1. Podman limits your options 
1. I just really Docker
