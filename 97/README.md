# Unimpressed with Elasticsearch Tech and Licensing

Even though I'm suppose to be supporting it and implementing it, and it
remains the darling of the Kubernetes world (nothing tops ELK in
enterprise popularity) I absolutely hate that Elasticsearch is entirely
written in bloated Java and has changed to a proprietary license. (No
wonder Elasticsearch seems to attract former Oracle employees.)

I was once a fanboy, but the more I uncover about what is under the hood
and the business licensing policies the more I am actively looking for
truly FOSS alternatives. In fact, there is a *huge* opportunity to
create an Elasticsearch type of thing purely in Go that is implemented
better, faster, and with a better API. They are sitting ducks waiting to
be blown out of the water by FOSS innovation. I predict a serious
replacement, written entirely in Go, will completely defunct ES within
three years. The smart people to take up the charge will make billions.

ES is shooting for lock-in, and they are doing a great job of it, but
that doesn't mean smaller companies won't throw it out for something
new.

Community member lousenti (from Twitch) mentioned finding Blast in Go
with an Apache 2 license that might be worth looking into.
