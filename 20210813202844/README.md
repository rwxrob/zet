# ZettelMark: Raster Image Figures

Only a single raster image is allowed in any single zettel, such zettels
are known as *figure zettels* and don't have any parallel in Luhmann's
original Zettelkasten method (although I'm sure he might have considered
it had he had a greater need for and ability to create images).

Here are the constraints on zettel figure images:

* Must be a block (it's own line)
* Must immediately follow the title or video line 
* Only a single image is allowed
* Optional alternative "description" in the Markdown link
* Only raster images may be embedded
* Only JPEG, GIF, and PNG images
* May be linked to SVG and larger images
* No larger than 1920x1920
* Name must be `fig-WIDTHxHEIGHT.{jpg,gif,png}`
