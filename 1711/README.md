# Q: What is this pomodoro extension in your terminal?

It's a little Bonzai command I made. You can find it at https://github.com/rwxrob/pomo where you can install it as a stand-alone or add it to your own stateful command tree monoliths (like my z command).

I'm always changing my duration on my Pomodoro timer. The "standard" is 25 minutes with five minute breaks and a fifteen minute break every 4 sessions, but that doesn't always work out with meetings and coding sessions. In fact, there's good science that contradicts the conclusion to always use 25 minutes, that it can break an otherwise amazing flow state in the middle. I'm going with top of the hour starting sessions and 15 minute breaks before the next hour starts. That's enough time to do some sun salutations, take some notes about what was accomplished, and make coffee. The 25/5 thing is just way to ADD for me.
