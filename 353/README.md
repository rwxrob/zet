# Learning `ed` Really Is Worthwhile

Been playing around with learning `ed` (finally after more than three
decades since hearing about it) and I have to say, I feel completely
stupid that I didn't pick it up before. It is drop dead easy once you
get the main concepts down, and since `ed` went on to influence tons of
other UNIX-y things (`grep`, `sed`, `vim`) having learned it makes me
more effective in those things. In other words, *yes* you should learn
“the standard UNIX editor” — perhaps even first — before learning other
stuff. Besides, you'll have bragging rights for the rest of your life if
you do. You can shut down every idiotic editor debate with "I use ed,
the standard editor" and you won't even be joking. The truth is, if you
are using `vim` to its full extent you *are* using `ed` (`ex` is the new
`ed` all the time). If you use `sed`, `grep` and a dozen other commands
you *are* using `ed`, which was the first to instigate all of those
things.
