# JSON Schema Seems to Have Won

The creation and of schemastore.org and its integration into all the
most popular IDEs has pretty much solidified JSON Schema's dominance as
the only method of performant, universal rich schema validation. JSON is
a horrible syntax for it, however, and so YAML has become the favorite
structured data syntax to expression JSON schemas as large projects like
OpenAPI/Swagger have chosen to do (as ironic as that sounds).
