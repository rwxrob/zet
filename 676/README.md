# FreeCodeCamp.org Go "Course"

Looks like the latest offering from freeCodeCamp doesn't look too bad
(which is unusual). Why? Because this one is entirely project based and
the projects are pretty damn relevant. Imma have to go through the whole
video on this one and give it an official thumbs up, but so far I'm
hopeful.
