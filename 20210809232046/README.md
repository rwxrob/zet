# Q: What are the chances of a Beginner Boost book?

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/6d9YIIUr4Gk>

Not good. Books get out of date far too quickly --- particularly tech
books. I'm not satisfied with GitBook and the alternatives (which made
really stupid base design decisions). 

Books do have advantages:

* Better written and edited than other online content
* Written with a specific audience in mind
* Have a specific author's voice and tone
* Can be opinionated with *good* opinions
* Combine expertise from several sources
* Can be compact

Books do have many disadvantages:

* Simply cannot keep up with the pace of new content
* Even online books fall woefully out of date
* Not really searchable, even digitally
* Difficult to hyperlink between things
* Only a finite set of opinions
* Very hard to publish and maintain, lots of overhead
* Can sometimes inhibit autodidactic practices

What happens after you write a book?

Who gets to use the book?

What do you charge for book?

In the end, I prefer a simple, searchable knowledge base over books, for
now. This means my priority is getting good content (in rough form) into
my Zettelkasten notes and eventually drawing on that content for
creating more formal publications such as books, blogs, and formal
curriculum.

It is more probable, that I will release my Zettelkasten content to
someone to use to create a book from it.
