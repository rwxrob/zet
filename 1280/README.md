# Rebooting SKILSTAK Learning Community

I was going to wait to first complete my Kubernetes certifications, but
I can work on that during work and really want to get SKILSTAK fully up
and running again. I've decided since I've already invested so heavily
in the SKILSTAK "brand" that I'll just keep it. This means I already
have all the marketing and even thousands of tee-shirts and hoodies for
those that want them.

The stuff that I cover at SKILSTAK, as always, is in a constant state of
flux. I remember paying hundreds of dollars to update the classroom
posters every other week or so with tweaks. (The local print shop loved
me.) I intend on maintain the poster PDFs again so that people can print
them out and hang them up if they want to chart their learning. I have
always loved having the visual aid. 

However, I'm thinking that the chart this time will be quite a bit more
complex since I plan to update it with the SKILSTAK OCMS badges instead
of just the larger semester blocks, as was required by the constraint of
meeting with a group in person. We don't have that any more. Mapping the
badges has been a herculean task, but once it's complete it will only
have to be maintained and will be very sustainable since it will be like
maintaining software packages that are composed into a full application.

Once again I'm reminded that coding people is much like coding programs.
Their method of storage is just different.
