# Zettelkasten Zettel Categories

I've falling into the practice of using the titles as a means of
providing a categorization that is useful to any potential reader as
well. It was quite by accident and out of necessity, which I suppose is
a very good thing. So far the following have emerged (each has its own
descriptive zettel as well):

* Figure
* Person
* Story
* Rant
* Book
* Film
* Series
* Site

I make sure that is the first word and include a colon afterward. I
contemplated using emojis for it, but just to hard to enter when doing
searches.

I find myself writing more of a review than anything when listing
something as if I've just been asked about it. For example, "Which books
to you recommend?" 

I've also added the following custom categories:

* Boost
