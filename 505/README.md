# Stay the Fuck Away from KodeKloud

Despite all the marketing hype, KodeKloud is disastrously bad at
preparing people for *real* work. Experimenting and building our your
own cluster in a semi-organized way that you do yourself, using your own
resources instead of a fucking web browser will *always* be better. Do
you really need to read that to believe it? It just makes sense.

Mumshad Mannambeth might be very wealthy at this point, but he doesn't
work in the industry and he doesn't have a fucking clue about real
infrastructure engineering. I know. I started his Udemy course in
Kubernetes and had to get a refund in disgust. His chosen job is promoting a learning style that
is just fucking wrong. Their "hands on" approach is all through a
fucking web browser! Do I have to keep telling you why this is so
fucking idiotic!?

One of the most terrifying things about this is that the Cloud Native
Foundation has chosen to validate that this charlatan is a "certified
training partner". But I'm quickly learning that the cloud-native
foundation is very frequently completely full of shit. I've tried to
stay positive, but Kubernetes.io is a fucking disaster. The "foundation"
clearly seeks profit over actually promoting the skills of *everyone*
(including those who cannot pay the money they require for their
"offerings"). This really pains me to say because I really appreciate
so many of the people who work there.

Most of this isn't their fault. All of this shit is part of the
pay-your-money-get-a-paper educational/training system that continues to
fail humanity. Just look at all those smiling faces with t-shirts and
pretty lazer-printed certificates. Surely, they are competent
professional infrastructure engineers now. "What? They have never created
a Linux machine from scratch nor installed Kubernetes on it directly,
ever in their life?" I'm sure they'll do fine. In the words of a senior
professional team leader from our stream community:

> I'd hire someone who has built and worked with their own Kubernetes
> cluster at home --- even with just Raspberry Pis --- over anyone with
> a certification or course of any kind.

*Real* engineers understand the importance of doing *actual*
experimentation, not in some protected sandbox with a web front-end. I
mean, are you really so fucking incompetent or cheap that you can't
create your own Linux hosts for this stuff? If you need a fucking web
browser to enable your Linux skills you are a fucking disgrace and
should be shunned by the IT world.

We need a new system.
