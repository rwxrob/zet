# "I didn't know what you guys wanted me to do?"

I heard an intern say this in a call recently and cringed. Here's a note
of reminder to help others breaking into the business know to not ever use
this sentence. Such behavior might make Forrest Gump look like a "God
damn hero" to his drill sergeant, but people in the tech industry (and
Star Trek episodes, which is a tech industry) are looking for more.

People expect a certain level of solutions research before throwing out
the "I dunno what to do" statement. Perhaps something that implies you
have already tried some other angles and come up with some different
directions. Then you present your directions and ask for a decision
about which *prepared* way to proceed rather than just asking without
any preparation at all. 

Of course, the circumstance depends. You might not have the luxury of
time to prepare solutions in advance, say in an emergency situation.
And, yes, often you are *supposed* to just do what you are told. But
usually a little forethought before making that statement will not only
keep you engaged in creating solutions and progress but also ensure
those around you perceive your dedication to moving forward rather than
just stalling out.

Honestly, it is not the fault of the person a lot of the time. Often
they have been bludgeoned by "traditional" education models so much that
even doing *anything* on their own makes them feel uncomfortable. But an
autodidact who is well habituated to learning and solving problems on
their own will just never let those words part from their lips.
