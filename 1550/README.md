# Mark Shuttleworth Failed at Desktop Linux

Mark Shuttleworth brazenly broke onto the Linux scene by unabashed
promising to make Linux ***desktop*** a mainstream thing. Canonical and
Ubuntu have been monstrously successful *for their server* but not for
their primary goal: a consistent, usable, dominant Linux desktop
distribution.

Ask any Linux fanatic today what their favorite *desktop* distro is and
they will almost always tell you some variation of Debian, Arch, Mint,
RedHat, or (as crazy at it sounds) Windows WSL2 (which is my new daily
driver). Some will get snarky and answer "Android", "Docker", or
"Kubernetes". If you mention Ubuntu on the desktop to most of these
people their face with get all distorted like they are suddenly
constipated. Mention "snap" to them and they just may punch you in the
face.

People hate Ubuntu desktop Linux so much they are flocking to Windows
and Debian. Both of which barely have a GUI installer. Even Debian
desktop users will tell you it is "psychotic" to even attempt it, but
Ubuntu desktop is really just that bad.

Why the rant now?

Because I have just started using Linux on WSL2 (which is Windows for
those who might not know) and it is a perfect balance of usable desktop
with powerful Linux tools. Hell, I can even play Overwatch on my new
favorite Linux "distro." MS (and the Linux foundation that is helping
them out) have finally done it. Ballmer be damned. Windows is the best
Linux desktop distribution by far. But, this didn't have to be that way.

Mark Shuttleworth's failures (plural, 'cuz remember Ubuntu on a phone?)
to deliver desktop Linux have almost destroyed the entire Linux desktop
movement sending it into even more shards of porcelain penguin pieces.

Snap would not even exist where it nor for fucking Canonical. Now
somehow everyone feels they have a right to try a better "desktop"
package system. 

Even Windows has Chocolatey (which is pretty damn good considering I can
now install Windows software, into Windows, from my WSL2 bash command
line without a problem). 

Some might call this pressured progress to make different options a
success, and I suppose it is in a way, but it has not solidified the
Linux desktop offerings in the slightest. Ubuntu desktop's suckiness has
emboldened everyone to try better leaving Linux desktop right back where
it was before, no fucking standard. 

And no standard means it remains impossible for large organizations to
get behind a standard Linux desktop distribution they can maintain for
their employees which, in turn, leads to no large Linux desktop distro
adoption, no critical mass at which point the entire business world
rallies behind the one true Linux desktop distro, like they do with
other FOSS things like Kubernetes, or (can you believe it) Chromium.

I can't blame Mark for trying, it's not his fault, for sure. Trying to
get the Linux community to agree on *anything* is virtually impossible.
It's just not in our DNA. Everyone has massive not-invented-here
syndrome and over-engineering mentality. We'd rather be different,
smarter, and "right-er" than everyone else rather than help pleebs use a
common Desktop Linux. Instead of praising the effort, they deride it
and make fun of those getting behind it, because, after all, most Linux
users are fucking assholes (including me). This the idea behind the meme
"I use Arch, btw." It's like a disease with us, a disease that has
killed (and will continue to kill) any Linux desktop attempt.

At least Valve supports their product on Ubuntu desktop. So there's
that. But good luck getting anyone to take it seriously, ever. I
certainly don't and I've been a Linux fanatic since 1996.
