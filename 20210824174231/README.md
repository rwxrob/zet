# Emacs Org Mode is Absolute Shit

This is why "org mode" is shit: lock in. Following the Zettelkasten
method that I use (or any variation) frees you from lock in of any kind,
other than on international standards like CommonMark. You can build
your own tools simply to do whatever, or no tools at all and just use
card "slips" or plain old paper.
