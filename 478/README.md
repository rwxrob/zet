# Q: Can I fork your zet/zettelkasten?

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/S4b6nYhQmMs>

1. You can fork `cmd-zet` and do whatever you want (Apache license)
1. You can fork (copy) of `zet` (full zettelkasten content) but that is all
1. You cannot create any "derivative work" of `zet` (including PRs)
1. These protections allow the option of publishing later
1. These protections stop trolls and assholes (or should)
