# Easiest and Cleanest Way to Shave Your Head

No joke. Use an electric shaver (no razor or water). 

1. Lean over the sink.
1. Work from back to front scooping the hair forward allowing it to fall
   in the sink. Don't look up.
1. Towel off the left overs.
1. Stand up and check for missed spots (you'll notice them the first
   time you are outside with a breeze).
1. Throw away the hair (never in the toilet, it seriously clogs).

That's it. Nothing all over the floor. Nothing on your shirt or
shoulders to clean up. I never razor because it is an unnecessary waste
of time. Fuzz is fine. I'm tell you. Do this and you'll be grateful to
yourself for saving a ton of clean up later.
