# Google Pixel Note Dictation Much Better

Out on my walk/run was able to dictate to my phone while listening to a
Podcast at the same time. I got to take notes about my impressions of
what the guests were talking about. Each note is like a miniature zet.
Next, I'll have to figure out a way to easily transfer them into my
Zettelkasten notes, but even just reading them when I get back and
transferring them into my zet repo is acceptable. This just put my
desire to be outside all day a lot higher on the list. Next up, get my
work slack to work so I can be walking around and still connected while
out and about.
