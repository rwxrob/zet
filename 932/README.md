# IBM GPFS is Absolute Shit

This is a warning to anyone considering IBM GPFS. Without divulging the
details of my employer I can tell you that "IBM acknowledged there was a
code issue" in GPFS that caused a full enterprise-wide outage of
critical systems depending on it. And this isn't the first time, we have
had at least four major outages in the last two years that I have been
on this account all because of GPFS being absolute shit. If you are in a
decision-making position of any kind, PLEASE DO NOT BUY IBM GPFS!
