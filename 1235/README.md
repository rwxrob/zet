# Just say no to GitHub organizations

I used to obsess about creating GitHub organizations so projects I
started wouldn't appear to be only from me. Big mistake.

**GitHub pulls non-profit status when it feels like it.** This happened
to me with SKILSTAK and I almost immediately lost all access to all the
repos I created under the organization. Whether or not this is because
of some requirement on their end, it doesn't matter.

**Organizations are expensive.** They cost money. Personal accounts
don't.

**They don't show off your accomplishments.** This is a big one for
beginners. When people are ranking your profile, your organization
participation isn't weighted the same as what you have done yourself.
Plus, the fact that you took the initiative to create the organization
in the first place is really buried under other information.

**You can always move to an organization later.** When and if the time
comes to move to an organization, say you have a ridiculously popular
project that is virtually impossible to manage, you can off-load a lot
of that work to a full project team.
