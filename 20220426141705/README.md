# "Info Commands" is What I am Calling Them

Some people call them "bang commands", but they have a larger scope than
those that provide information and act has hyperlinks once did in the
past. *Info commands* are single words that begin with a bang (\!) and
pull up an *info node* that fits under 380 characters (an arbitrary, but
good, size set by Twitch/IRC). This size also fits well in Tweets. And
God knows the world is obsessed with bite-sized information these days.

I'm using YAML for them with the title as the key and a reference link.
I generally start them with emojis of some kind as a way to roughly
categorize them. I don't think I'll every formalize that. It just
ensures that info command output doesn't get mixed up with real output
from me if my bot is running as me. I can have synonyms as well with
YAML.

The info command tags themselves also make amazing Twitter and zettel
tags, so there can be some interlinking using that.
