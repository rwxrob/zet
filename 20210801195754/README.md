# Avoid "Whiteboard" Interview Companies

1. Huge red flag about the company
2. Lazy companies that don't want to properly evaluate
3. Probably illegal
4. Prefer companies that look at your work
5. Good companies will want to get to know you
6. *Not* indicator of success or efficiency or even skill
7. Not just a "necessary evil"
8. Coding fast is not indicator of producing value
