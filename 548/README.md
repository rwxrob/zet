# Discovered killer.sh has Course Environment Scripts

Most people know that killer.sh is where you train for the CKAD, CKA,
and CKS certifications and that you get two free attempts for each cert
that you sign up for, but most might not know that there is a lot to
learn just in their GitHub repos without using killer.sh at all. For
example, they have a POSIX shell script that sets up an environment for
use with Kubernetes and very clearly outlines the steps to take an
Ubuntu server to a fully functional Kubernetes cluster. Just reading the
scripts is very instructive.
