# Should I Do 2020 Boost First or Just 2021?

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/9H-75G8s2Vs>

You just found all these videos and don't know where to start and might
be a little worried about missing something that was covered before.

First of all, the source of current truth (opinion) is always going to
be <https://github.com/rwxrob/boost>. Make sure to check that first. All
playlist and videos are taken from it. It's too difficult to constantly
remove or update videos, so we focus on the outline itself.

Know that the latest videos will usually have important changes from
stuff that was true just a year ago. For example, we moved to containers
instead of installing Linux on hardware between 2020 and 2021 and we
saved a lot of time doing that.

Just be sure to use the most recent content to save the most time.
