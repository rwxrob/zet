# Finally, Only the Terminal Essentials in Boost

Here's the final draft of the overall outline for the newly revised
*Linux Terminal Boost*. I think the hardest thing to finally just drop
is *any* coverage of web development at all. Instead of spending even a
single minute on learning HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, we will learn how
completely unnecessary the web is and use GitHub `README.md` files and
personal profile repos instead. We will use Pandoc, and definitely talk
about how it can convert to HTML, but we'll focus on how it can be used
to convert Markdown into readable text even more than that. Web
development is just a fucking huge distraction (and always has been).
Besides, everyone covers that as if the world depended on learning
React. It doesn't. Linus Torvalds has publicly stated that he doesn't
even consider "web development" development at all (which is hyperbole,
but his point is well taken). Every second spend making a web site
pretty is one that could have been spent making something that has
actual value. Perhaps it has been this burden that has been finally
lifted (like being lied to as a Mormon) that has made this difference.

The lie is simple and the truth has set me (and others free): you don't
need web development skills, period. In fact, learning machine learning,
data analysis and systems engineering is far more important.

## Linux Terminal Boost

Get started right. Become a shell native. Here's what we'll learn:

0. RWX Learning Method
1. Docker for Developers
2. Leveraging Linux Containers
3. Linux Bash Command Line
4. Bash Scripting with Vim
5. Screen and TMUX Multiplexers
6. W3M and Lynx Web Browsers
7. Git, GitHub, and Docker Hub
8. Markdown and Pandoc
9. Go Command Line Programming

This is the way.
