# Military Path to Hacker Jobs

These days, and I'm not even joking about this, I would seriously
consider going into the military right out of high school.

Why?

Because even in America you can choose a specific entry path in the
military into opsec/cybersecurity (and only opsec). Sure you have to
learn to shoot and do the bootcamp thing (which would be the hardest
part for me not to yell back at the drill sergeant) but the amount of
knowledge you get is well worth it to me (if what I'm hearing all turns
out to be true.)

Here's roughly what I think I'm hearing that people can do today to get
into a great hacker career without paying a dime:

1. Graduate from High School
1. Research your countries cybersec military recruitment
1. Can you *specifically* request cybersec only? If no, forget it
1. Do your bootcamp and suck it up, get healthy
1. Learn all those crazy hacker skills with full perm to pwn
1. Get out and work for government or private sector
1. Pentest and zero-day your way to millions ;)

Apparently, this is easiest in USAF where the training is best. In
Marines "everyone is a rifleman", etc.

Keep in mind that following this path means that the government will
permanently own your ass, even after you leave. You will be on a very
important list of people to watch/recruit/harass depending on what you
choose to do next, but if that level of clearance is fine with you, it
looks like it can be a very fulfilling and challenging and *safe* life
for someone wanting "leet" hacking skills.

Here are a few in the industry with background:
