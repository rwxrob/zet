# Flexible Workspace Strategy FTW

In operations and security you need to get your tools fast no matter
where you are doing work. This is particularly true if you are a
contractor or consulting working with multiple accounts, all of which
have their own infrastructure, policies and such. Having your own
workspace stuff means you don't have to depend on a team having or using
your favorite tools (which is often a problem for me because most don't
care to use `tmux` the way that I do). Here are the different workspace
use cases:

* Home workspace (usually a desktop)
* Home laptop (Mac, Win, or Linux)
* Work workspace (usually Win or Mac laptop)
* Remote systems out of K8S cluster (Linux terminal)
* Remote systems in cluster (Linux terminal)
* Remote systems from backdoor hacks (any OS, no tty)
