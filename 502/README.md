# Importance of Modular Digital Workspace

Been really feeling the need and value of having *everything*
modularized in my digital workspace so that I can simply switch, as if
sitting down at a different computer optimized for a given task or
occupation, and just get working.

Problem is, you have stuff you need in common in all of them, your
toolbox, per se, but you aren't allowed to easily take all the exact
same tools with you between each work session.

In the physical world you would take time every session at the beginning
and end of a session to take out and pack up your tools. The work may or
may not be there to work on (already). You use the same tools on
everything. That favorite chisel, or whatever.

In the digital world carrying your same tools around isn't possible. The
best you can do is modularize those tools so that they can be combined
digitally and you can copy the latest version of your tool to each
digital workspace. This is the idea of a digital workspace, and it's
nothing new, as it as the heart of the DevOps and Cloud-Native IT
revolutions.
