# Static Compiled Go FTW!

I cannot overstate how valuable having a statically compiled utility
language like Go is for the getting-shit-done type of development. Any
Go binary can serve as the `FROM` line in a `Dockerfile` unlike anything
in Python or even non-statically compiled C code. Rust can do the same
(but with a lot more hassle during its creation).

This also means that I can copy and paste that `go` bin file wherever
the hell I want so long as the underlying architecture is compatible.
This is just so fucking amazing. Few will appreciate it like I (and
others) do who have been around the block and seen all the abysmal
alternatives to this --- particularly from the interpreted language
fans. No fucking interpreted language can ever touch this, none of them,
including Java.
