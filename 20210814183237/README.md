# Q: Why no zet SSG actions to render?

Because a Zettelkasten repo is meant to be personal knowledge base, not
for groups. It can certainly be used for group or community knowledge,
but in such cases requires a single gatekeeper account. 

Also, people generally want to preview their rendered `index.html`
before publishing it (or at least they should want to).
