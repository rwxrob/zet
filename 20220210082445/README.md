# Apt/Debian/Ubuntu/Kali First, Then Yum/Rocky/RHEL

I feel really good about focuing only on `apt` system for the first part
of the Beginner Boost focused on tools, practices, and programming. It's
hard enough to master one package management system.  Then, later, we
can do all the RHEL stuff in part II, the infrastructure engineering
boost.
