# China Fails to Manipulate Linux Team

I really love that the Linux team is just [too smart] for China's efforts
to slowly grab space in the kernel to try to push their exploits under
the auspices of seemingly innocuous purposes. Linux team be too damn
smart for that. Denied! For this reason alone everyone should use Linux.
