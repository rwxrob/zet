# Professors are Not Professionals

Even though the root of these words is identical, modern educational
universities cause one of the biggest problems in society. The
"Professors" have never been "Professionals" in any capacity. Most
doctorate recipients haven't stepped one foot in the professional world.
To make it worse, these non-professionals are given "tenure" ensuring
they have no accountability to anyone or anything. They are "free to
think and innovate" but they have no pragmatic framework for generating
anything of actual value for society. It's this "trickle-down
intellectual economics" idea that is destroying modern social
workforces. They ideas never fucking leave their overpriced, overly
bombastic and verbose text books designed for one purpose: to please the
others of their species who will force their subjects to pay for the
fucking thing without a choice in the matter. It's the worst elements of
any Leninist economic system. The solution is to separate these people
into think tanks and let the rest be *actual* professionals focused on
instruction and mentoring, not teaching, more trades. But while the
University set continue to use "practical" as a slur against their
academic opponents this will never happen.
