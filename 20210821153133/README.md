# No More Music on Live Streams

I realized that giving up my options with music has, once again, stopped
me from streaming more than anything else. Perhaps the biggest benefit
to this tech career that locks you in front of a screen for 8-13 hours
a day is being able to enjoy the most amazing music all fucking day
long. I've always been a massive music fan, and giving that up just to
pipe chillhop consistently all day through my live stream is just not
worth it. 

I had to pipe one specific playlist because it was the only list proven
to not get YouTube to block my stream. Twitch doesn't care because I do
not save any of the VODs.

Another side-effect was I couldn't even use my own damn Spotify account
when running and stuff because it was locked and running with the live
stream. I'm *not* buying a Spotify account just to pipe it all day when
people might not even like that music.

Instead, I will continue to post which song is playing and create more
responsive commands that say what music is playing at the moment and
where to get it. In fact, I'm going to enable a lot more of the `!`
commands because so often people cannot see the about page when they are
watching Twitch.
