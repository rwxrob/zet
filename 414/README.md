# How I Personally Fight Off Depression

I get asked this a lot on my Twitch stream (unsurprisingly). And
recently there was a Serbian Twitch streamer in her 20s, which her whole
life ahead of her and so much to be thankful for, who killed herself.

First of all, it is never as bad as you imagine. The reason you think it
is so bad might be chemical and you need *real* help from someone
besides me. But I've found some things that help me.

* **Find someone to help.**

  There is always someone in need of your help. I don't care how much
  you personally think you have nothing to offer anyone, you absolutely
  fucking do. Even if it is just helping someone get their groceries
  home, or sweeping a sidewalk that you don't own, or just listening to
  someone about their day. There is *always* someone in need of your
  help. Get busy finding who those people are and it will help you
  forget about yourself.

* **Go outside.**

  I forget to do this all the time. But being outside, looking up at the
  stars and sky, which are the same for everyone on the planet, is a
  simple way to find joy. Watch the sunrise or set or stare at the moon
  and stars and wonder. The sky and nature are *always* there for you,
  for everyone. Nature is my temple, and running my worship.

* **Exercise.**

  It doesn't have to be a big production. Go for a run or hike or do
  some yoga or push ups. I prefer things that don't build up more
  anxiety (cross-fit isn't my thing). I prefer exercise that promotes
  harmony between me and my body, not that pits me *against* my body,
  forcing it into submission. Yoga, martial arts, Tai-Chi, climbing,
  swimming, are all examples of such exercises.

* **Force yourself to smile.**

  There is good science that forcing yourself to smile actually triggers
  neurologic responses that raise your mood even if there is nothing to
  smile about. So that children's song, "turn that frown upside down" is
  actually scientifically based.

* **Stay busy with positive distractions.**

  For me that is coding, streaming, playing music, watching a positive
  movie, enjoying a good game that isn't toxic. Some people like to cook
  or read. Being busy keeps me from thinking about the problem. It is
  hardest to do this right before bed. That's when massive anxiety
  usually strikes me personally. I know its chemical, and try to just
  read or watch a movie and fade off to sleep instead of letting my mind
  race.

* **Find a community.**

  Humans are social creatures, even the most introverted. Don't give up
  on seeking out people with common interests to yours. Twitch is a good
  place to randomly find them, but there are many other places. Meetups
  in particular. I prefer things where I can see the faces and hear the
  people rather than just read because so often just text isn't enough
  to avoid people who are very toxic.

* **List what you are grateful for.**

  Creating a list, actually writing it down, gives something for your
  mind to do that is positive. Force yourself to find *anything* you are
  happy for, even if all it is is a good blanket or beer or friend.
  Write that shit down. Read it all the time. There's a good chance
  you'll start to see everything and be like, woah, I have it so good,
  much better than so many others. Then, go find other people and help
  them get to have things to be thankful for as well, one of them being
  knowing you and your help.

* **Listen to positive music.**

  I learned the hard way during my massive depression *not* to listen to
  Linkin Park and other angry, emotional music. It was very appealing
  because it matched my feelings ("What I've Done" has become the anthem
  of my divorce and depression, I still can't listen to it without
  balling my fucking eyes out). But here's the thing, I realized that
  listening to the downer, sad songs was just perpetuating that state in
  me. I *forced* myself to only listen to Jack Johnson, Indigo Girls,
  and other upbeat stuff and, like forcing yourself to smile (I
  suppose), I automatically got happier. Joseph Campbell once said when
  asked by Bill Moyers what we humans could possibly do being so
  dependent on mythology but having lost almost all of it what the next
  best thing was and Joe said without hesitation, "music". Music is the
  closest thing to a universal "religion" that all humanity can easily
  share.

* **Watch Linux workers on a Monday going to work.**

  You could be living in the Antarctic and have wings but can't use them
  to fly. Consider that.

I'm sure I'll think of more thing later. But these are the main ones off
the top of my head.
