* As of today `kubeadm` requires swap be off
* Still pursuing "host containers" with `kubeadm init`
* Lots of `Dockerfile` work to get deps installed
* Mounted `/var/run/docker.sock` to all using same docker
* Systems are running (made it up to health check errors)
* Ready to start doing more with `kubeadm` config
