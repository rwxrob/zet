# Use 'Service' Instead of 'Daemon'

This discovery angers me. I just tried to speak "daemon" into my phone
and I got the name "Damon" back. This means that unfortunately I cannot
use it as a command name because I am going to strictly ensure that any
interface I ever create can be spoken. I'm rather pissed, but oh well.
Speaking `zet service start` is going to work where the alternatives
will not.
