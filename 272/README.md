# People Fleeing Oracle, Thank God

Just met two different people on the same ElasticSearch customer support
team who came from Oracle and bagged on how bad customer support was at
Oracle while they were there. I'm blown away by how many people stayed
at Oracle despite the shit that company has thrown over and over again
at every body, and yet the money kept on rolling in. I wonder if it had
anything to do with Amazon telling them to fuck off when Oracle tried to
lord Amazon's dependency on Oracle over them. Amazon made their own. One
thing is for sure, run screaming from recruiters trying to get you to
work for Oracle. The company sucks at a level that far surpasses all the
others out there, including Google.
