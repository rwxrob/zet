# Use `/usr/bin/env bash` for Personal Stuff

When I see `/usr/bin/env bash` in professional stuff it really makes me
cringe at the crazy level of inefficiency and insecurity some people are
willing to put into production shell scripts. But, since I know run my
personal scripts on every possible architecture, distro, and
configuration on the planet (it seems) I'm forced to acknowledge this
usefulness *for personal stuff only*. Let me say that again.

***Only use `/usr/bin/env bash` for personal stuff.***

Having said that I will now replace `/bin/bash` with wild abandon in my
dot files because I need them to work on my Macbook Pro where the
fucking idiotic Apple company has decided to put the latest and greatest
bash at `/usr/local/bin/bash` instead of `/bin/bash` as god intended.
Fuck Apple for picking zsh as the default despite is severe inferiority
because they are afraid of litigation with GPLv3. I hate it too, but
come on, Apple has the money to fight that shit if they were ever
attacked.

People who willingly throw away the incredible power of bash for zsh
just for the licensing concerns or worse, for "oh-my-fucking-zsh" ---
even though the zsh team pleads with people not to use it --- are not
making choices in their true best interests.
