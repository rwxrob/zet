# Bonzai Branches with BonzaiMark for Education

I don't know why this didn't occur to me before now, but my emphasis on
BonzaiMark and really readable documentation for any Bonzai `Cmd` has
inadvertently created the best edtech tool I could have wanted to
helping people learn, well, *anything*. Like `skilbots` before,
anything that can be done on the command line --- and documented ---
falls into Bonzai, but so too does anything I might want to document
through a friendly web interface. In fact, I'll extend BonzaiMark to
have images and assets that are resolved from the embedded file system
(with proper `alt` tag support, of course). Being able to encapsulate
all the learning of a particular section into a Bonzai branch that can
also monitor and assist the user on the local system as they complete
tasks from the learning in the documentation --- including interactive
web content leveraging the local browser --- just might be the holy
fucking grail of instructional technology frameworks. Educators need
only download and run a single binary, that can even auto-update itself,
go get people doing hands-on learning immediately, and the learning
Bonzai branches are also completely portable, meaning they can take them
home and use them on their own systems. I don't think I have ever been
more motivated to see one of my crazy-ass ideas through to full fruition
and adoption.
