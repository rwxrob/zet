# People Love ASCII Art and Chillhop Stream

I'm so glad I returned to my roots from December 2019 when I started
streaming nothing but my terminal and music and ASCII art. Now that the
IRC is on the screen it is even better. I've been through several
"unhinged" moments on my live stream where I cannot decide what I want
it to be about and the style and feel of it, but, as I should have
known, returning to just a clear terminal with `asciiquerium` and
`cowsay` and `weechat` makes all the difference. There is something
really enabling about just having a chat box to manage. I can do my
writing and searching and let people follow along for a bit of variety,
I suppose. They don't seem to mind unless I leave the fishies off for
too long and they start to get vocal. 

Another reason this really works is that the IRC component promotes
people being able to have it up at work as well and not miss anything.
Unfortunately, I cannot do what with the rest of the terminal, although
I recently learned that there is terminal streaming apparently that only
uses text. I really have to look into that. That would be idea for other
workers in my field.

So this zet is just to say that my original instincts were on point. I
should have stuck with them. I'm happy. I'm socializing. And, most
importantly, I'm still getting crazy shit done every day without losing
any efficiency.
