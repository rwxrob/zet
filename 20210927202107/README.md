# Boost Badges: Level One, Basics

***Basics***, level two, is where you get an initial introduction, often
guided, to the idea or skill. You gain just enough experience and
knowledge to make a decision about whether to pursue
further learning in that area.

> For example, the `nano` editor is not recommended, but one might never
> understand why unless they had a *basic* understanding of it, unless
> they had tried it. For some there might be a compelling reason to
> pursue learning `nano` further, for most not. You could make the same
> example with something from the non-tech world, like *Basket Weaving*
> or *Pottery*. Dismissing something you haven't even tried is usually a
> bad idea. There's no shame in getting the Nano Boost Badge, it means
> you can debate about its value more responsibility having tried it
> despite everyone's recommendation against it. Same for Emacs, or
> VSCode.
