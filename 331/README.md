# Use Vi/m to Remotely Edit Files

Today a new "senior" member of our team today who asked in a public team
chat room:

"What does everyone use to remotely edit files? I've tried sshfs and
VSCode."

I laughed my ass off. I guess "senior" doesn't mean what it used to.

BTW, this person was pushing to have zsh installed as well.

    #rant #linux #vim
