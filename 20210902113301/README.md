# Boost: Writing Style and Conventions

* Explain why Boost content is in first-person
* Identify newly introduced terms
* Locate definitions for terms
* Recognize callouts and sidebars
* Understand difference between fenced and raw blocks
* Determine source of an inline or blockquote

This is me, Rob, writing this right now. I've always preferred
first-person style when writing content because it gets me closer to how
I would communicate if I were in a one-on-one private mentoring session
with you (yeah, *you*). This might strike you as odd compared to the
writing styles of the academic resources you've read in the past. 

> 😃 Honestly, I think they are the ones doing it wrong, not me.
> Learning and mentoring *are* personal and should focus on the
> individual, not the people forcing those individuals to buy something.

That last paragraph (technically a ***blockquote*** from HTML and
Markdown) starts with an emoji. I like emojis. They are like a modern
form of ***cuneiform***. I use them to give meaning to turning
a paragraph or section into ***callouts*** and ***sidebars*** from
popularized by traditional publishing. You have seen them as those boxes
and things on the side that are related to the current content but not
directly. If you see an emoji at the beginning of one of these blocks
here's what it means:

😃 something happy or funny  
💡 an idea or tip  
💬 some chat, or story, or commentary  
🤬 a rant, usually that would include curse words  
⚠️  a warning, or caution, achtung!  

You might have noticed that ***callouts***, for example, was bold and
italic. Bold-italic is reserved specifically for ***terms***, meaning
that they are likely to be found referenced in the 'Related:' section or
otherwise have their own zettel and glossary entry. Pay attention and
memorize these when they occur. They are key to mastery and will be used
a lot by myself and potentially others interviewing you one day.

This content is also full of ***fenced*** and ***raw*** (unformatted) blocks. Fenced blocks are always code or output that you would see on your terminal:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo 'Hello world!'
```

```
$ ./hello
Hello world!
```

Raw blocks are simply text that need to appear as is without any
formatting, such as addresses or poetry or ASCII art:

       _ ____      ____  __
      | '__\ \ /\ / /\ \/ /
      | |   \ V  V /  >  < 
      |_|    \_/\_/  /_/\_\

> ⚠️
> Fenced blocks are never rendered in places where special
> characters are not allowed, such as in a YouTube video descriptions,
> which is why every learning node with a video has a full zettel of
> written text to go along with it.

And one last convention that is a hold over from traditional publishing,
any time you see a name in parentheses after an inline quoted phrase it
is a reference to the person who said it. That person's name will always
appear in the 'Related:' section at the bottom of that same zettel.

Here's an example, when I say "don't get mad, get busy" (Rob) you
know what I mean.
