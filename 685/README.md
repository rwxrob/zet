# Arch Safer Than I Though, Still Not for Beginners

Today I was politely corrected in my understanding of `pacman` on Arch,
which, it turns out, has no direct access to the wild and woolly AUR (so
I'm told). There are tools like "paru" that get around this, however.
Eventually, I'll need to confirm this for myself, but I feel better
knowing that is true. It means that the beginners shamed into not using
Arch as their first Linux distro are going to be a bit safer even though
recommending Arch to *all* beginners is still fucking irresponsible.
