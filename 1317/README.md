# Distinguish Yourself by Learning Shell Coding

During a random conversation with someone who was recently interviewing
a lot of KCA certificate holders it became clear that that had no idea
how to do *problem determination* in general and even less clue how to
write even a simple shell script. Truth is, it warmed my heart. I was
leery about teaching shell scripting as a first language (along with the
Linux terminal) and I could not be more free from that doubt now.
Learning POSIX shell first, and bash almost immediately after that
should *always* be the first languages *any* technologist learns. Even
if you think all you are going to do is create web sites, you will be
using the terminal in *any* technical profession today and as soon as
you touch the command line you *are* coding in shell. Might as well
learn the rest of it so your terminal usage is all that much better. It
is really crucial to get those skills in early because like scales on
the guitar, if you don't learn those skills early you bake in
alternatives that are never quite right. Unfortunately, almost no
organizations are teaching any shell skills until far too late, and
those that do don't even know how to use the fucking shell in the first
place.
