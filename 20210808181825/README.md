# Mim, Community Knowledge Management

Mim is an open source knowledge management system designed to work best
for communities of interest with a single primary maintainer ---
especially when live streaming and media production are involved. It was
original conceived and created by an over-worked educational streamer
who also had a full-time job and needed a digital imp to take care of
the more mundane stuff.
