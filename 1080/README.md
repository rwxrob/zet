# Publishing Twitch Videos to YouTube

At this point I think I have exhausted ever approach to publishing
Twitch videos to YouTube that is possible. I now believe that the best
option to include with IRL streaming is the first (original) approach.

1. Push long videos with chapters/bookmarks
1. Create shorter ZettelCast videos with a zet to go with each
1. Create longer videos that are stitched highlight clips (StreamLabs)

I am proud of the `zet cast` commands I made for YouTube. It was a nice
way of creating small videos. But that method has a few problems

* Forces you to create a zettel for every video
* Requires tight OBS integration and customization beyond most
* Gets out of sync
* Takes a lot of work to manage
* Violates the idea of a "zettel" because it is sort of published

The StreamLabs clips are so amazing, but they also have problems:

* Still long videos result
* Videos are always limited to same tiny length
* Have to hit the record button every time and time right
* Takes a while to stitch the video
* Still doesn't have any YouTube description to search

Here's the thing: IRL streaming is *always* going to be long form, so
creating a method for dealing consistently with long videos will
encompass IRL streaming and desktop/educational streaming, that is, if
you do it right.

The most crucial part of long form is adding "chapters" (bookmarks).
Without them and the descriptions that link to those bookmarks the video
is virtual useless. It doesn't show up in searches, and is cumbersome to
get through. Creating chapters an be a community effort as people watch
them and not the changes.

Remember, however, that there is a limit to the number of "chapters" you
can put on a video. I forget what it is, but have hit this limitation. I
think it is safe to say that if you limit educational videos to four
hours that it will never be reached. I only hit that when I was
streaming for more than 10 hours a day. 10 hours, by the way, is the
maximum length for a YouTube video (officially).
