# Hey Look, `yq` Doesn't Suck as Much

I've tried to like `yq` in the past, I really have. But it continues to
fail me in different ways that were really critical. But one of those
things has been (finally) fixed. You know do not have to type an `e` to
evaluate stuff and don't need a `-`. So yeah, it now actually does what
`jq` has always done.

Imma take the best parts of `yq` out and put them into a Bonzai branch,
like immediately. I do so appreciate the work that has been put in, and
that they decided to release it as they have. I just really can't get
into any project that use Cobra at all, just a personal pet-peeve. I
want a world that is free of unnecessary `.bashrc` sourcing just to get
`complete -C` completion because of Cobra's horrible design premises.

* No More `e` and `-`
