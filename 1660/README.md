# Super Impressed with Github Dependabot

Yet another reason I see nothing wrong with Microsoft taking over
GitHub is that there have been a log of developer-centric improvements
with GitHub as a platform that were never envisioned for Git itself. One
of them is Dependabot. For the higher profile libraries (like the YAML
one here) I get nice analysis that suggests I fix things. I even get this wonderful notification during my commit (because I don't read the emails).

Bravo GitHub! This is amazing. Thanks for all you do to improve open source development for everyone and make the world a better/safer place.
