# The Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve

[Hermann Ebbinghaus] in 1885 discovered memory loss is rapid and huge within the
first few days of learning. But, it gets better after that. Ebbinghaus also
discovered another phenomenon called overlearning during his study on
forgetting curve. The basic idea is that if you practiced something more than
what is usually required to memorize it, the effect of overlearning takes
place. This means that the information is now stored much more strongly and
thus the effects of forgetting curve for overlearned information is shallower.
