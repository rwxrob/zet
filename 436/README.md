# `kubectl describe` is the `ls -la` of Kubernetes

Probably not the first command people learn, but definitely one of the
most important. I am constantly confusing it with `kubectl inspect`
(which isn't the same thing). I use `k describe` to look up pretty much
everything. Want to `exex` into a node servicing a deployment? This is
the one command to find it.
