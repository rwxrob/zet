# Do You Use Alacritty as Your Terminal Emulator?

No. I used to, but it's too buggy and alpha giving problems at
inconvenient times. Just not worth the hassle for what it provides:

1. Consistent YAML configuration file that hot-loads
2. Wicked fast (but most of time don't care)

Major bugs have prevented me from using it:

1. Does not in work in full-screen on Windows with notifications
2. Has very limited support for ANSI escapes (not blink)

What instead? 

I use whatever is on the system:

1. Gnome-terminal
2. New Windows terminal
3. Mac built-in terminal
