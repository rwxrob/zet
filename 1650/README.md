# Boost Badges: Level Three, Proficiency

***Proficiency***, level three, is the enough skill and knowledge to be
paid professionally for it, to get a job involving it. You are no longer
dangerous, you have had enough experience to fail and learn from it and
are less likely to fail on the job doing it. You can be trusted to
perform.
