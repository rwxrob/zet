# Pixel Fitness App Counts Heart Rate with Camera

So I'm out for a late night stroll trying to get my steps in (so I can
get healthy enough to move us later in the Fall) and discovered that my
Google Pixel can actually give you an EKG-level of precision heart rate
just by putting your finger over the camera and the light. The app is
clearly tracking changes to the images and maps them to a running graph
that shows your exact heart rate as it is happening. That's just fucking
amazing. We really live in the future.
