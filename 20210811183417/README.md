# Type Dot (`.`) from Any GitHub Repo to Open Full IDE

VSCode has been fully integrated into GitHub. You can now tap the period
(dot) and open the GitHub repo in the new "Web Editor". This has huge
implications for education, knowledge management, writing, and existing,
similar services (like <https://REPLit.com>) not to mention keeping your
CV up to date. I have to tested on mobile devices.
