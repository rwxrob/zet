# Q: Was there ever a time that you liked C++?

I was obsessed with it when the STL first version came out in late 90s.
I had learned C but decided C++ was really the cool thing to learn, when
I got into it I really didn't like the entire idea of streams (which I
know you don't have to use if you don't want to) and the fact that some
would write C and others C++. I really think the two should be
considered completely different languages. I prefer Go for most things
that others would do in C++ and if I were to code a game, I would do it
in C\# with Unity because I would *never* work professionally for any AAA
~~sweat~~ shop doing game development of any kind.

I have nothing C++, I just don't think it solves many modern problems
and would be hesitant to recommend it for green-field projects. So many
other languages cover all the landscape that C++ has covered in the
past.
