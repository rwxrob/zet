# DCO CLI is Enough for Contributions

GitLab has simplified the process of FOSS contributions to their
flagship product by adding the following clause to the project and as
such have removed all the unnecessary complexity of CLA bots and such. I
trust the legal team at GitLab, which is tasked with protecting the cash
cow of the company, with such things much more than the many FOSS
projects that have over-engineered other approachs:

> By contributing to GitLab, you are deemed to have accepted the
> agreement (DCO, or Corporate or Individual CLA) applicable to your
> contribution.
