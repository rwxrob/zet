# Stallman Couldn't Even Finish `ed` Man Page

Sometimes Stallman reveals just how much of a fucking idiot he can be.
Even though `emacs` violates the UNIX philosophy worse than any of the
original applications he decides to plug it in the `ed` man page and
mysteriously leave off the rest of the sentence when naturally
completing it would have required he write `vi`. He's a fucking prick
and most people who follow what he says to the letter end of regretting
it in one way or another. Seriously, is your penis so tiny that you
cannot even mention the other editor for fear people won't still want to
use yours. It warms my heart that `emacs` is still the preferred editor
of a very tiny few, most of whom where fucking forced to use it during
college and cannot get off of it now.
