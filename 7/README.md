# Don't Depend on `jq`, Learn Builtin Alternatives

Recently, I was on a system with `kubectl` and did not have `jq`. It was
the first time I regretted no investing the time to learn JSON path and
Go template form, both of which are included within `kubectl`. So it
makes sense to eventually learn these even though `jq` is far superior.
You can't always be sure you will have it.
