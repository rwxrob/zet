# Things Linux Desktop Fucked Up for Me

I'm done with Linux desktop distros, and as I've been enjoying the
migration to Windows WSL2 I'm reminded of several very specific problems
I've had over the years since starting to stream in early 2020. Every
one of these things caused at least some amount of annoyance and, in
some cases, significant pain and suffering, and loss of time, hearing,
and money:

* All desktop fonts went blank
* Loss of Super/Windows search combined with window zoom
* Insane random black screens and crashing with using Steam games
* Buggy USB support for Yamaha MG10XU sound board
* No initial support at all for Logitech web cam (came a year later)
* Screen tearing in every fucking 3D application (even with fixes)
* Horrible 3D frame rates for all games (Streamlabs gets it every time)
* No support at all for Streamlabs (I don't give a shit that not FOSS)
* No Spotify current song in Twitch stream (coded my own)
* Randomly switching sound devices and volumes without warning
* Could not run SolidWorks even though have the licens
* Dependable keyboard character creation (ex: â„¢)

Keep in mind that I went through the pain of doing my own X11Config in
2005 in order to get four cathode-ray monitors into a multi-display
setup. I've put in the fucking time. I've proven I *can* do the Linux
shit, I'm just old and tired I suppose. I don't wanna any more. I have
too many other significant things to work (sorta of like Rob Pike, who
uses a Mac).
