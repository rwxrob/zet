# Naming `cmd.go` was Best Decision All Day

Something like this seems so trivial, but when I'm managing dozens of
Bonzai branches having the one with the Version in it that always needs
an update be named the same thing everywhere is just something I really
appreciate. Naming conventions like this are what make developers happy,
at least the ones like me who don't want to think more than they have
to.
