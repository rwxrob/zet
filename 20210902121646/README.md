# Keep Quotes Grouped in Separate Zettels

I've gone back and forth on how to include quotes in my zettelkasten
repo. At one point I had them all in a huge file, but that doesn't work
because I cannot comment or further describe my interpretation of the
quote. 

You could make the case that quotes are always a part of a larger point,
but that gets messy fast. For example, say I collect quotes of nice
things people have said about the Boost. That list could (hopefully) get
pretty long. Does every single one go in the same large zettel?

On the one hand that makes them all easy to find.

On the other, that makes for a very large zettel.

I entertained the idea of making a `Quote:` category and then quickly
realized most of the quotes would not fit within the 50 characters
allowed in the title. This further makes the case to just have a zettel
with a succinct title, and put any and all quotes related to it in the
same one, no matter how large it gets.

Keeping the quotes grouped by topic also provides more value when
creating more formal content from the zettel itself. I would randomly
pick from several quotes for the chapter headings of a book about
roughly the same topic.
