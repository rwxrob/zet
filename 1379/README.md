* Rethinking the news, perhaps something more edited
* Making VOD highlights a lot more and pushing to YouTube
* Thinking of replacing `zet cast` with `zet cast sync`
* Flattened Node Feature Discovery and JupyterHub Helm charts
* Decided to keep Helm tarball around
* Decided to always flatten Helm charts (no more Helm)
* Many respected Kubernetes authorities do *not* use Helm
* Thou shalt *not* use Operator Framework (worst than Tiller)
* Ruled out mounting gimbal to chest GoPro harness
* Adding fitness streams (running, yoga, dancing, whatever)
* Rode Wireless Go II + Cloudlifter works well with board
