# Record While Streaming with OBS for YouTube

There is nothing simpler than clicking "Start Recording" during a
regular Twitch stream to create YouTube videos. Plus, you can click on
the pause button during the stream to take breaks that even include
DCMA-able music. Then, when you upload the recordings you also don't
suffer from double-encoding artifacts and get very high quality videos
for YouTube that are simple not possible by clicking "export" from
Twitch VODs.
