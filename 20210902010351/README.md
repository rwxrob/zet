# Boost: Learning Room (Knowledge Node)

* Describe what a *learning room* is
* Explain how a room is just a node in a tree
* Identify the main parts of a room
* Be able to navigate through rooms
* Visualize your own learning path, even map it

Without getting too kitchy and carried away with this metaphor, you can
visualize the Boost content as being part of a huge dungeon or series of
escape rooms where every room has something to unique to learn or do in
order to move on. There's a lot to learn and sometimes holding onto that
visual can really help keep your sanity. If you know what a is you can
think of it as a MUD for learning or ***MUDL***. Since each room is
captured in a ***zettel*** you can appreciate what psypheric1 said while
I was writing this:

> "Don't get yourself in a MUDL when learning. Just zettel down and
> you'll learn a lot more than you thought." 

This connection of rooms with doors all starts with a single entrance.
The formal name for such a structure is a rooted node tree, where
everything starts from a single point and then branches out in different
ways at each point of connection with some points interconnecting on
occasion. Formally, I call these points of content and connection
***learning nodes*** (a specialization of ***knowledge nodes***, a
concept from the Knowledge Exchange Grid/Graph KEG project), but
informally we call them ***rooms*** for the sake of the Boost as in the
following:

* "Hey, what room are you in?"
* "Woah, that room was tough?"
* "Can you help me escape this room?"
* "Where's the project you did for the ... room?"

The structure of a rooted tree of learning nodes allows you to choose to
cover just the minimum or to continue more deeply into any specific
topic or skill while managing the interdependencies in natural way.

You might know some examples of this structure from the gaming or tech
world already. A skills tree in a game like Dota2 is a simple version of
one. Every time you open a web page and "Inspect Element" you see the
Document Object Model (DOM), which is also a rooted node tree. 

Perhaps the most significant example can be found in the 'Choose Your
Own Adventure' books and turn-based role-playing games like Dungeons and
Dragons. First you read (or are read) the content for that "room" and
are then asked, "What do you do?" In this sense, the "room" is
a knowledge node, the description is the knowledge followed by an
invitation to assess your understanding and take action. This is the
same for learning nodes, "rooms" of learning, as if stuck in an escape
room where you have to unlock each one before proceeding (except that
nothing is actually stopping you).

Sometimes your choices are obvious, sometimes not. But they are always
up to you. One choice is to not make any choice at all. You control your
path, within certain boundaries to keep things from getting really
crazy.
