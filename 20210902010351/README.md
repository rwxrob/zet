# Boost: Learning Node

* Describe what a *learning node* is
* Identify the main parts of a node
* Feel comfortable self-assessing against node objectives
* Be able to navigate forward and back through nodes

The format for Beginner Boost content has taken on the structure of
a rooted node tree where everything starts from a single point and then
branches out in different ways at each point of connection. I call these
points of content and connection *learning nodes* (a specialization of
*knowledge nodes*, a concept from the Knowledge Exchange Grid/Graph KEG
project).

The structure of a rooted tree of learning nodes allows you to choose to
cover just the minimum or to continue more deeply into any specific
topic or skill while managing the interdependencies in natural way.

You might know some examples of this structure from the gaming or tech
world already. A skills tree in a game like Dota2 is a simple version of
one. Every time you open a web page and "Inspect Element" you see the
Document Object Model (DOM), which is also a rooted node tree. 

Perhaps the most significant example can be found in the 'Choose Your
Own Adventure' books and turn-based role-playing games like Dungeons and
Dragons. First you read (or are read) the content for that "room" and
are then asked, "What do you do?" In this sense, the "room" is
a knowledge node, the description is the knowledge followed by an
invitation to assess your understanding and take action. This is the
same for learning nodes, "rooms" of learning, as if stuck in an escape
room where you have to unlock each one before proceeding (except that
nothing is actually stopping you).

Sometimes your choices are obvious, sometimes not. But they are always
up to you. One choice is to not make any choice at all. You control your
path, within certain boundaries to keep things from getting really
crazy.
