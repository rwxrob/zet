# No Shame in Shaving the Yak

I love yak shaving. They seem to appreciate it so much. ;) Truth is,
Donald Knuth, the "Patron Saint of Yak Shaving" having invented TeX
(later LaTeX) to typeset *a single book, The Art of Computing* all those
ump-teen years ago. Thank God he did. Modern publishing has been
revolutionized because of it.

"Shaving the yak" means different things to different people, to people
I like and agree with it means discovering something revolutionary while
indirectly trying to get something else accomplished. I like this point
of view because I do it all the fucking time. Here's a list of my own
personal yak shaves:

* ZettelMark, `zet`, et al.
* PEGN.dev
* SkilBots
* The Essential Web Specification
* The Knowledge Exchange Grid (KEG)
* Beginner Boost
* MUDL Development Method
* RWX Learning Method
* Every utility script in dot files
  (`yt`,`twitch`,`iam`,`topic`,`twitter`,`gh`)

This is mostly a place to keep track of all my personal examples of
these. Ironically, shaving the yak often helps me to discover that I
didn't need to do that other thing at all, that another direction would
be *way* better that I would not have seen had I not allowed myself to
"go down that rabbit hole" (the other, less-cool phrase for the same
thing).
