# Back to Bi-Modal Sleep Schedule

Ever since vacation happened and somehow I landed back on my normal
sleep schedule where I sleep twice a day I've felt a weird giddy
elation especially when working and playing through the night while
everyone else is asleep here. I can't explain it. It's like my body
wants to sleep twice day, like it's normal or something. I've read the
stuff on it and apparently humans are not necessarily coded to sleep 8
continuous hours a day. None of our closest mammal friends do, and
humans have been having a "second sleep" since the time they have been
able to write about it.

The best part of it is the double dose of early morning super brain
power and energy that comes from this instead of lagging on through
four hours of unproductive crap. I know that I have organize my best
brain work at optimal times during the day and that if I blow that time
on stupid stuff it doesn't matter, I lose it.

I did notice that doing yoga for a while there somehow set me on a
single sleep schedule, but not for long. I've also noticed that the
double sleep cycle thing happens a lot when it's really cold outside.
I can't explain it. I'm just reporting for myself (and others).

Here's what my schedule looks like lately:

Time | Sleep
-|-
10pm | wake
4am  | sleep (5 hours)
9am  | wake
7pm  | sleep (3 hours)
