# Pick Better Sources of Tech Information

Recently, I ran across an amazing article describing the radical changes
at IBM and why Red Hat will continue to dominate the enterprise Linux
market. It has solid facts, was written by a Ph.D. and contained sane
predictions about the reality of where things are going, no matter what
his (or my) personal opinions are about having to face that reality.
You'll never glean this sort of information that from most shit on the
Web, because YouTubers, Twitchers, bloggers, and people on Medium,
Hacker News, Dev.to, and Reddit usually don't have a fucking clue what
is happening in these significant companies.

To get a clue you have to alter your sources of information, get more
enterprise-y about it. For example, this author is a dry writer, and
perhaps overly analytical. But, he's very good. Would he *ever* post a
fucking thing to Reddit? Pfffhahahaha. No fucking way. Yet his opinion
is well researched and rather objective, unlike pretty much anything on
Reddit or the Web. If you want to stay relevant, you *must* vary your
sources of critical, decision making information, including what desktop
Linux to run if you want it to further your employable skills and keep
you relevant.
