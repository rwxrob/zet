# Everything Uses Kerberos

As much as I don't particularly like Kerberos, it is *everywhere*. It is
the main authentication engine for PAM, which is the main authentication
engine for SSH itself. It is also the main engine for MS Active
Directory. So as much as I might hate it, understanding how it works,
and how to maintain it, is an essential skill for any experienced
infrastructure engineer. I'll be making sure to add a full Kerberos
setup to my enterprise home lab.
