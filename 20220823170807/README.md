# Everything Uses Kerberos, Learn It

Until recently, I might have (wrongly) asked someone, "Do you use Kerberos *or*
Active Directory?" They are now the same thing.

Kerberos is *everywhere* (now). As recently as May 2022 even Azure AD
now uses it as the primary authentication engine. Kerberos has been the
main authentication engine for many significant things for more than a
decade, like PAM, which is the main authentication engine for SSH
itself.

Learning how Kerberos works, and how to maintain it, is an essential
skill for any experienced infrastructure engineer (or hacker).
Therefore, a full Kerberos setup should be a mandatory part of any
enterprise home lab.
