# Yet Another Reason *Not* to Use Python

Python is one of the least secure languages anyone could pick for
developing enterprise software. On the same day I read a caution from
someone on the developer list at work warning about the GIL and how it
is impossible to write truly concurrent software in Python without
significant work arounds I read this *massive* security bug in PyPi.

Come on Python, we were enjoying making fun of NPM for this kind of shit
and there you go being just as fucked up as them.

Yeah, people who choose to write green-field entrerprise software
projects in Python — which, let's remember, is a loosely-typed,
*scripting* language — are fucking morons at this point.

Did I hurt your feelings? 

Is Python your favorite script-kiddy language?

Sucks to be you. I don't give a shit. 

Go GIL your PyPi. Enjoy being slow and pwnd.

* About half of Python libraries in PyPI may have security issues, boffins say • The Register: <https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/28/python_pypi_security/>
