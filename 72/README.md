# Integer KEG node IDs are saving my ass

I've been actively writing all day on this KEG Specification and the number of times I've changed the titles of these nodes has been insane. I cannot even imagine what I was thinking about making those titles actually require a slug directory name change every time. Plus, having just an integer to deal with makes it trivial to remember during the writing.
