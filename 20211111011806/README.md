# Q: How about organizing tech conference on Twitch?

1. Yes, eventually
1. Start small, regionally and IRL *with* remote
1. Work it into bigger `afk.works` regional meetups
1. Not until *after* Open Credential Merit System (ocms.cc)
1. PEGN promotion and adoption (pegn.dev)
1. Nothing with Kubernetes (already has Kubecon)
1. Might consider creation a Kubecon Twitch liaison
1. I don't really do conferences
