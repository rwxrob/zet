# Zettelkasten Brings Peace of Mind

The greatest advantage of Zettelkasten is being about to let go of an
idea or thought rather than obsess about it and know that I have a
reliable way to get to it again --- and more importantly --- so does
anyone else who has GitHub access to it with search. This means that
eventually, when time is available I can publish works that contain that
content but the content is immediately available and valuable by itself
without any extra work.
