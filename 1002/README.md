# Kubernetes `man` Page Equivalent: `kubectl explain`

If you depend on `man` and Internet searches as much as I do then
learning `kubectl explain` as one of your first commands committed to
memory makes a lot of sense. It's basically `man` for Kubernetes.
Anything that creates an "Object" has to create one. It is the place
where you can see all the different fields that go into that confusing
YAML file required to code/configure any of this stuff. I am always
forgetting this command because `inspect` and `describe` are also
commands (that have nothing to do with `explain`).
