# Sort Spotify Playlists by Date Added to Monitor

Just discovered a great trick for monitoring playlists on Spotify that
you really like, but have already filtered into your own playlist subset
of songs. The problem is that you can't just dump the whole playlist
again into your own because you'll add back all the ones you took out.
Then you discover the "Date Added" sort and click the twisty to put only
the latest adds to the playlist at the top of the list. Then you see "4
hours ago" and no to see if you want it. I have all my Monitoring
playlists (most of which are hugely popular and have changes all the
time) in my own "folder" and check it every once in a while to see if
there's anything I want to add to my own sub-collection.
