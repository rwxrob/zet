# How Fucking Stupid Were the Moron Quora Developers?

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/y2IX1pqOnZ0>

People can say that Quora requires JavaScript to read their shitty
questions and answers site, but that doesn't make it legal. There's a
strong chance that they are not meeting baseline accessibility laws (for
which PizzaHut was convicted). Even StackExchange allows their
text-heavy site to be read, why not Quora? I believe the reason is
simple. The morons who conceived and developed Quora, and the bigger
morons who funded it, have no fucking clue about Progressive Design and
the requirement to accommodate the least available technology, in this
case a basic text browser or one with JavaScript disabled. Please stop
using Quora, tell your friends. The only thing they listen to is profit.
Put them out of business for making this shitty decision that affects so
many besides just those who don't enable JavaScript.
