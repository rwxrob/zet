# Series: Happy-ish

I was so pissed when Happy-ish didn't get renewed. One of my all-time
favorites. Yes it's pandering to my generation. I don't give a fuck.
It's dead on. It could be the most accurate portrayal of Nietzsche's
greatest fear become realized in our time.

Here are some of my favorite quotes:

> "I'm not supposed to look like that. I have a job, a wife, and a son.
> Abs tell the world that you're one Twinkie away from killing
> yourself." (And then the hot dude says, "It's true. I hate myself.")

I was looking at photos my wife sent me that I sent her, of being, um,
well, I had abs. But, I mentioned that I was more depressed at that
moment than at any other. I threw myself into physical fitness because
it was the fastest path to joy, the high of endorphins. In fact, I used
triathlon and endurance sports as a coping mechanism most of my time as
a Mormon married to a woman that I'm not thankful to have escaped. It's
true. The times I looked the best, I was often the worst inside, but not
always, sometimes the high and joy from good health is enough to really
counter chemical depression. I look forward to having good health and a
good mental state again. I do hope the two aren't actually mutually
exclusive.
