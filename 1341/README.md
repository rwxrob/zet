# Logs Should Be Terse and Time Based, No Details

The logs should be really terse and just state what happened
when, not get into the details of the specific topic. They should read
like a story or history or captain's log. Now if the log entry is about
an event describing that event --- even if that description is not short
--- is fine.

But there is really no need to add a log entry after adding each and
every random [zet] entry. Those are already chronological. In that case
a general log entry describing the feeling and need to write about a
particular topic is a better log entry.
