# Twitch and Discord Legal Copyright Statement

Anything you say or do while on this stream in chat, or in Discord, in
text or voice, in public or in private (as a whisper) becomes my legal
intellectual property. When in doubt, don't say it or write it. This is
to protect others and myself when I use comments, quotes (without any
requirement for attribution) and content from the community in my own
copyrighted material as videos, clips, podcasts, lessons, books, or in
any other way. Everything I do will *always* be "free forever" in some
form, but I reserve the right to publish that same content for a price
as well (usually just to cover the cost of printing and distribution).
