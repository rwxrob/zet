# TMUX Columns and Windows Terminal Font

I run a TMUX (tmuxin) within a TMUX (tmuxlive) and have adapted by
create new windows to create two panes at once. Here is the important
information:

* 79x25 left large pane
* 20x25 right side pane
* Ubuntu Mono, 28 point

On Windows Terminal this is readable in portrait mode from a 2021 Google
Pixel phone, which is about average.  Anyone with a smaller phone would
just watch in landscape mode, which is why I always put the chat on the
screen.
