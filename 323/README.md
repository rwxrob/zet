# More Lies from IBM About GPFS

Even though IBM is really great at pushing and marketing GPFS, a lot of
the marketing is just straight up lying:

>  What is IBM SpectrumScale / GPFS. SpectrumScale, initially called
GPFS, was developed over 25 years ago as the enterprise's first
distributed software storage solution. The primary purpose was to
coordinate the concurrent access to a SAN (storage area network, see
here) from many clients.

IBM "General Parallel File System" was created in 1998 for AIX and 2001
for Linux.

Why lying? Because GPFS came out ***14 years after NFS***. In fact, it's
quite clear at this point that IBM essentially stole the best ideas of
NFS from Sun (and later Linux) to create GPFS.

Bottom line: never, ever trust a company that brags about its patents
every year to provide any honesty in their product offerings.
