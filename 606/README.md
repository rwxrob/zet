# Take the Time to Rename TMUX Panes

The automatic names on TMUX panes are nice and all, but considering how
easy it is to set the names (just `Leader-,`) you might as well do it
and same yourself from reopening them all the time and getting
unpredictable issues with your history in each of the panes. The time
you take to rename them will be made up easily in the time you save by
just burning those numbers into your muscle memory quickly during a
coding or hacking session. Plus, if you are streaming people get a
better idea of what they are looking at on the screen.
