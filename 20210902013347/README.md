# Learning Nodes are Knowledge Nodes

The term *knowledge node* came out of the work on Knowledge Exchange
Grid/Graph as a generic way to describe what I'm also doing with a
single zettel. But after starting the Beginner Boost formal writing I
realized that someone more was needed that included the learning
objectives rather than just generic knowledge. I started calling them
*learning nodes* and we'll see how that goes.
