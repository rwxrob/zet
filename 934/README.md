# Lurkers Turning My Words Into Their Profit

I won't go into details, but I now have several specific examples of
other *huge* YouTubers and streamers covering content that is almost
verbatim something I have said or covered in a way that defies time and
coincidence. I'm flattered more than anything. After all, they have a
much bigger audience that I, and at the end of the day I don't care as
much about getting credit for my words and advice and discoveries as
much as I do getting them out to *everyone* no matter how that happens.
I have to admit there is at least one of them that makes me really
cringe because of the way the content is changed into YouTuber
sham-wow-guy marketing spew, but oh well.

I feel better getting that out. This has been happening my whole fucking
life. One dude at Nike actually cut and paste my entire email without
changing a single fucking word and resent it as his own proposal. Thank
God my manager, Barb, had my back and brought me into the office for a
little laugh. She spotted it immediately, "Isn't this the email you
sent?" It was so bald-faced it was ridiculous. I loved facing that dude
and just smiling at him about it. He was beat red with shame and that
made me *very* happy. Yeah, I was the one that won the most prestigious
Nike IT award there is, the "There is No Finish Line" for which you must
be nominated and selected by your peers, and no, he never won anything,
ever. I wonder why?
