# Adding Daily Nitrotype and Minecraft

Recently, I realized that I was starting to spend more time playing
Dota2 and TF2 than actually helping people (my main goal). While
thinking about ways to make it more fun, I remembered what I was doing
all those years at SKILSTAK with my beloved community there. We would
"code and play" together, learning and relaxing. A big part of that was
playing Nitrotype against each other, and another was setting up,
maintain, securing, and playing on an amazing Minecraft server together.
I'm bringing all of that back. 

I'm planning to do the sandwich approach: Nitrotype to get going, then
an hour of Boost content in the middle, followed by a half hour of
setting up and playing on our community Minecraft server. I'm actually
really excited. I fucking love Minecraft and I've been away from it for
too long. The creativity it brings on so many levels is just to valuable
and fulfilling.

Right now the schedule has it all starting at 8pm daily. I think having
it be a habit is just a good thing.
