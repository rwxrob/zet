# Stop Calling YAML Maps "Dicts"

Nothing shows how corrupted our technical vernacular has become by
Python than everyone suddenly calling associative arrays, more commonly
known as "maps", "Dicts". Everyone keeps calling these collections
"lists" and "dicts" and even if those words make slightly more sense
they are fucking wrong. Here's the official [YAML spec] that clearly
calls them "maps". I'm annoyed because even to find them I had to wade
through a bunch of incorrect shit on the Internet. They are FUCKING
maps, god damnit! ;)
