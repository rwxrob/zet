# Use `json` and `yaml`, Not `jsn` and `yml`

I know it is largely a personal preference, but the YAML creator
officially asks that the suffix `yaml` be used. They tried to do this
shit with `html` and `htm` and it never took off, thank God. I've been
tempted up until now, but I'm holding my ground. Four letters or fuck
you! ;) The Kubernetes team says you can use "either" --- cowards.

To be fair I was tempted to use `data.yml` for everything I'm doing with
KEG and have decided to drop the suffix entirely and just use `data`
since both YAML and JSON are both compatible data formats. When
implemented in static site generation this will produce the best
possible URLs (ex: https://rwx.gg/data). It's a simple enough matter to
create a Vim file type for anything called `data`.

Maybe just using the `yaml` word is better. Since JSON is YAML that
works.
