# Q: Do you have more than one Zettelkasten?

I have three currently, one that is public, one that is private, and
another one just for work (that is only available on work systems and
over VPN). I have found dividing by topic or category eventually fails
as cross-overs manifest between seemingly unrelated things (mechanic
work on engines and OOP SOLID principles, or whatever). Having things
that seem never to be related somehow trigger inspiration just might be
the point of keeping everything together. It certainly makes it easier to
search.
