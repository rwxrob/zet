# Number 0404, Lost or Strong?

My wife has ruined me in many fun ways. For example, I can't stop
wondering what certain numerology patterns are when I take particular
notice of a number. Well, today after returning from an amazing run,
after having had a great day of streaming and learning and remembering
authentic moments of my past including the intense impact Second Life
had on my real life, I looked at the huge numbers on my Coros Apex Pro:

0404

Immediately, I had to look it up. I'm still soggy and sweaty, but I had
to know. Then I get this "Angel Number" page:

     A numerological combination 0404 is very powerful, so if you have
     received this number from your angels, it could mean that you are a
     blessed person. Number 4 is a symbol of constant evaluation and
     knowledge.

     This number also means that you are evaluating and analyzing
     everything around you. Number 4 is also associated with family,
     balance, stability and justice.

     On the other side, we have number 0, which makes the meaning of
     number 4 even stronger.

     The most important characteristic of people who are guided by
     number 0404 is their ability to communicate. They love to talk and
     to give tips to other people. Sometimes they also criticize others.
     Now you will see other characteristics and secret meanings related
     to angel number 0404, which will help you understand better its
     meaning.

Now I can rationalize the technique of creating very universally
believable things, but my god, anyone who knows me and spoke with me
today would tell you that is fucking astounding.

I'm not a true believer in this stuff, but I do believe something bigger
than ourselves is happening, and that it uses whatever message vehicle
you are looking for to communicate. Perhaps this was one of those times,
perhaps not. 

It could just mean that I'm "Not Found" depending on who you talk to.
