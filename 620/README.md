# Local Virtual Machine, Cloud, or Home Lab Server?

It seems to me there are several phases of infrastructure engineering
learning and development that naturally progress in complexity and cost:

1. Linux over ssh connected to VMware virtual machine
1. Linux running from `docker run`
1. Linux over ssh connected to cloud virtual machines
1. Linux on bare metal (laptop, desktop, server, SBC)
1. Linux over ssh connected to own server(s) on bare metal
1. Linux over ssh connected to virtual machines on own servers
1. Linux over kubectl on k8s on machines on own servers

1. TODO (stuff diverges)

1. Linux in a local VM
1. Linux in a local container
1. Linux in multiple local VMs
1. Linux on bare hardware
1. Linux VMs in a server on bare hardware
1. Linux VMs and containers on a separate server
1. Linux VMs in the cloud
1. Linux containers in Vms in the cloud on bare metal
