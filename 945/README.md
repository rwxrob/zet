# Go Gin is Great, Learn It

I'm usually that annoying guy who says, "Why aren't you just using
`net/http` but lately I've been defaulting to the `gin` "micro-framework"
instead. Gin has exactly what most people need and not a bit more.
Specifically, it has regular expression routing, clean contexts and
middleware modularity, and the ability to mock everything cleanly in
unit tests. It also happens to be the strongest Go generator in the
OpenAPI set from which to pick.
