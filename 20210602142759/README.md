# Bandcamp Friday for Musicians

So @savagebananasoup told me about [Bandcamp Friday](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=Bandcamp Friday) and I'm really
glad I learned about it. With a full-time (traditional/high paying) job
these days I might be able to help out. The amateur musician in me wants
to help them out.
