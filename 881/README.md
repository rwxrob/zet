# Avoid K9S for Kubernetes (for now)

1. It's not standard
1. It wastes screen real-estate
1. It's yet another thing you have to install
1. It's irrelevant (no one uses in production)
1. It masks learning *real* skills
1. It screws up your muscle memory
1. It doesn't follow the UNIX philosophy
1. It cannot be used as a `vim` filter
1. Just use `kubectl` (at least if you are starting out)
1. It's like using a GUI with `git`
