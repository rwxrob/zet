# Use `cloc` to Count Lines of Code

Sometimes you want to get a sense of a code base quickly to know what
you are dealing with both in terms of scope and languages used. There's
really nothing better than the `cloc` program to give you that insight
quickly. (I used this yesterday to see that 27k lines of Helm are within
range to replace the whole thing.)
