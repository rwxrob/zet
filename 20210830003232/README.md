# Beginner Boost: Start Here

Learning is why we are alive. We all start out life with more or
less the same skills (or lack thereof). It's our abilities and
opportunities that differ. Life is about discovering what they are and
learning to make the most of them.

Every single one of us is following our own path. It's how life works.
Different choices lead to different outcomes, like a "choose your own
adventure" book or a role-playing game where the experience and rewards
are real, if you work for them.

Some skills and concepts
build into different ones, while others are at the base of everything.
I've put together this choose-your-own-learning adventure based on my
own experience and that of others, but ultimately, the only one in
charge of your learning is you. Don't worry, you can change your choices
any time, even play this game in different ways.
