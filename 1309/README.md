# How do you get your keystrokes to show on the screen?

A tool called `screenkey` that has been configured for streaming out of
the way in the bottom right corner. If you do decide to use it, make
sure to learn `control+control` or whatever to disable it so that you
can reliably turn it off when entering any password or secret
information (yes even KeePassXC or cut and pastes).
