# Bash Bible Author: Dylan Arap

Dylan had the hubris to call his creation the bash bible, and the
amazing skill to back it up. I need to read every line of code he's
ever publicly published. He's one of the greatest bash masters on
Earth. He also wrote the POSIX shell bible. People ask me, "What book
should I read to learn bash?" I'm always at a loss because there isn't
much *beginner* material for bash (which I aim to change) but anything
from Dylan should be on the top of the list once you have the basics
down.

    #bash #shell #vips #posix #scripting
