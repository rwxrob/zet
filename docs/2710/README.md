# Even on own stuff use merge/squash for small commits

Just was working on some of my own stuff and noticed that my habit of making very tiny commits that feel like tracks of incremental development don't get squashed unless I follow my normal process of creating a draft PR and committing them there so they get squashed and merged later.
