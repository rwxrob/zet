# My pronouns are we/us/they/them üòè

My wife continually laughs at me when I mistakenly use "we" to refer to something I'm doing at the moment, so I'm just owning it. My official pronouns are therefore we/us/they/them. Yep, I've become a hive mind like the Borg. All the streaming and recent writing on behalf of the SKILSTAK Learning Community (<https://skilstak.io>) has sort of burned "we" into my brain.

And why not, why not live in a state of mind that fosters the idea of inclusion and community. While it might be me writing it, it isn't just me with the shared interests and ideas. In many ways, I is incorrect since so much of who I am has come about from the collective contributions of many other people.
