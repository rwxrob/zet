# Chance of thunderstorms while in Zwift?

For the last three days in a row our Internet has been knocked out along with the power during the increasingly more powerful thunderstorms in the afternoon. This makes anything important that requires the Internet virtually impossible to rely on during this time. One of those things is a long Zwift climbing session on a route with an achievement. Getting one of these interruptions destroys any progress. This would be fine if it were something like a game of Overwatch but it is horrible when it is something that has literally taken a bunch of sweat and hard work to earn.

Here are some mitigations:

* Play from mobile phone instead.
* Change from using wired Internet to wireless mobile modems.
* Ride stuff in Zwift that is not impacted by interruption.
* Don't use Zwift at all.
