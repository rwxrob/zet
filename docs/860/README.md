# Use https://groke.se/twitch/spotify/ for `!song`

This allow the following command to work:

```
{readapi.https://groke.se/twitch/spotify/?db6e44917a20ad6113d8bd93620a748e}
```

Don't worry, the token doesn't have any special permissions.

Discovery of the `readapi` command possibilities with Streamlabs
`cloudbot` are just amazing. Anything accessible as a URL can be used.
