# Don't Need for Discoverability

I've come to realize that all the discoverability I ever need is already
provided by Go dependencies now for the Bonzai project. People can just
look at the rwxrob/bonzai project and see all the others that depend on
it. Then, we can create a registry that summarizes them in a searchable
way. In other words, no more `bonzai-` prefixes. Hell, I don't even use
`go-` or `-go` anymore. Everything I do is Go so there is no conflict.
