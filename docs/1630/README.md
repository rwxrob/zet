# Stop Stream and Restart When Topic Changes

As annoying as it is, it is the only way to update notifications and
titles on Twitch and YouTube. The hard part is that if I don't stick
with the topic for a significant amount of time people get annoyed. I
suppose just doing the AFK stuff is at least something. During the work
day I cannot ensure a full Pomodoro session even without interruption.
