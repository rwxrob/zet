# ðŸ“ž Where can I get your theme?

I use a slightly darkened version of GruvBox on a 100x25, Microsoft Terminal (1920x1080 screen) from which I ssh into "anton" (my local Ubuntu Server vm in VMWare named in honor of Gilfoyle) and run nested TMUX. Font is 28p Ubuntu Mono with wrap set to 72 columns when writing code comments. I used to do transparent background for streaming but it was murder on my eyes.

All my files are in my dot files (including my Microsoft Terminal Preview JSON file).

Zsh has nothing to do with my theme --- including the prompt.
