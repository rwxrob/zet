# ðŸ“ž Do you still do 1-1 mentoring?

No. I only did that after a bunch of drama that forced SKILSTAK to do it, but I learned that 1-1 mentoring is really the one true form of education in the process, but it requires that the person doing the mentoring have *real* experience, preferably current, so not everyone can do it. It is also the reason most academic approaches to skills training are so flawed, you can't teach it unless you know it and have proven you can work with it.

Most of this video is me explaining why I don't do it it any more (and getting mad about how badly life seems to have screwed me over trying to do what is right).
