# Don't learn Rust first

Let me tell you a story of the first person who ever told me about Rust.

A person who paid me to mentor them was HUGELY into Rust (mostly because of the active, vibrant, enthusiastic community, at least, the ones who didn't resign in disgust over the hypocrisy of the steering committee). This person had received a psychology degree but could not find a job. That's why they started paying me to help them.

I was open with them about it and let them make their own decisions, as always.

One day they said, "Ya know, I really need to learn Go to get a job. There are zero Rust jobs."

I agreed, but this person had to come to this realization the their own, which was hard.

They learned Go and almost immediately got a job making 100K a year starting salary specifically because of learning Go, and then they also got to work on Rust there.

Most people learning a language are doing so to become productive and employable, like my friend. Rust distracts you from these goals.

While it is an exciting language for a very specific niche of applications that are yet to be determined, it is a huge fucking waste of time for MOST people reading this.[^1]

Like my friend, do yourself (and your family) a favor and master Linux, bash, python, Go, and even JavaScript before even wading into Rust. Then you can waste your time learning Rust if you really want. I don't.

And, please, for the love of God, learn enough C to understand what all the Rust hype about "garbage collection" and memory management and dangling pointers is even about. Otherwise, you just sound like a sheeple idiot trying to justify your decision to learn Rust first without knowing a damn thing about how software actually works.
