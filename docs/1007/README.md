# It's Just Plain Stupid to Learn `docker-compose`

I cannot stress enough what a fucking waste of time it is to learn
`docker-compose` in 2021. There is *nothing* it does that Kubernetes
doesn't do better and with more opportunity for growth. But, seriously,
you have to be bordering on stupid to maintain any cognitive resources
dedicated to `docker-compose` at this point. Here's why.

The *overwhelming* industry direction is to use Kubernetes for
everything. Even Google's own internal teams are moving *off* of BORG to
Kubernetes. Meanwhile, a few people are still using `docker-compose`
mostly because that is what they started with or because they find it
somehow to be simpler.

Re-invest all that mental energy into *truly* learning Kubernetes and
`kind` locally for everything. Then all your knowledge will apply to the
enterprise and edge as well as your own personal development.
