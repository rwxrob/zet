# Personal logging in KEG/zet with hlog

Making written personal chronological log entries is something people have been doing since writing became cost-effective, and by different names: journaling, writing in your diary, or keeping a captain's log. Whether it be capturing the wincing pain of a teenage crush or the yield of an atomic explosion test humans have been keeping logs to make sense of life and track its events.

I have long kept a journal. My mom got me started on it. I have stuff as far back as eight years old written down. Soon I started typing everything, just more fun I suppose. I do still love to use paper and a written journal, however. But the accessibility of my zet (KEG) has made it the logical choice for a place to add my notes. 

I added a `hlog` command script to my dot files to produce the following output:

```
# LOG20231003080243: Tuesday, October 3, 2023, 8:02:43AM EDT
```

This is intended to be the first line of a new entry. It will ensure that these entries always sort properly. Eventually, I'll add this as a command to `zet` itself. It is still within my strict design criteria of not adding anything to my `zet` system that could not be maintained by hand.
