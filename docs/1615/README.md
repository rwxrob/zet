# Possible Book Titles

Even though I have most content organized as if they were Tech Scout
Merit Badges, pulling together content from several of the badges/rooms
could be incorporated into a book or booklet PDF that people could read
from beginning to end. This is one moment where the zettelkasten
approach really shines. The same content can be composed into different
forms.

* Learn Like a Hacker
* Contain Yourself with Docker
* Live Linux from the Terminal
* Leveraging Linux Containers
* Become a Shell Native
* Linux Bash Command Line
* Bash Scripting with Vim
* Screen and TMUX Multiplexers
* W3M and Lynx Web Browsers
* Git, GitHub, and Docker Hub
* Markdown, PEGN, and Pandoc
* Coding C to Comprehend
