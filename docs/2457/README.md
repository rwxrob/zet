# Recipes

Here are my recipes for the food I've been eating since 2010 when I've been my healthiest. These are my favorites because they cover the nutritional bases but are ridiculously quick and easy to make for anyone. (I *hate* wasting time cooking things when I don't have to. Some people like cooking to relax. Not me. I do love the smell of oatmeal cookies cooking though.)

There is a catch. Many of these recipes are impossible without a gadget. I've been known to take my Blendtec blender with me on camping trips and would probably bring my salsa maker now as well. I've just come to expect that I cannot use the blender during the early morning hours so I save my recipes with the blender until later in the day.

## Gluten?

I'm not "gluten free" but I'm picky about it. I only eat homemade white bread that I've made with *good* flour when I do eat bread, such as on long bike trips when a digestible complex carb is needed and I don't feel like yet another rice ball. (I suspect most people have a problem with Monsanto wheat.)


## Dairy?

I love cheese, but it *really* doesn't love me. I try to avoid it as much as possible with the major exception of Parmesan on my tomatoes and almonds salad and one measured cup of lactose-free whole milk that I drink with my morning oats. (Just washes them down so well.)

## Order?

I generally eat dense carbs in the morning and lighter carbs (fruit and veggies) throughout the day with the exception of Kaffee (coffee) & Kachen (cake) about an hour before working out in the late afternoon. The egg burrito bowl is one of my favorite big meals that I know is going to trigger my body moving digestive focus on rebuilding (and knocking me out usually for the rest of the night). I used to eat eggs in the morning to curb appetite and it works. But I was seriously carb deficient as I continued to train more than two hours a day (making me tired all freaking day). The [Racing Weight book](https://amzn.to/47quAJg) convinced me to pack almost all my protein into the end of the day. It really seems to work. Except for the regular immediate drowsiness after any meal I genuinely have more energy for everything during the day by reordering my macro-nutrients.
