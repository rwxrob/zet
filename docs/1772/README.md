A **filter** is a computer program or subroutine to process a stream, producing another stream. While a single filter can be used individually, they are frequently strung together to form a pipeline. Usually, this term refers mostly to commands that accepts standard input with the intent to transform or "filter" the incoming lines or buffer.

Filters are a core part of the **UNIX Philosophy**. Modular, composable, filters are the UNIX way, not plugins. Learning to use filters in pipelines from within Ed/Vi/m are critical to learning universal UNIX/Linux scripting skills that work on any system without installing any additional editor or IDE.
