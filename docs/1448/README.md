# Dismiss Apache Syncope Just for Being Java

I'm shopping for a good FOSS IAM offering that is zero-trust friendly.
But Apache Syncope is *not* it.

I love that it is now en-vogue to just throw out shit written in Java
because it may or may not have the Log4shell vuln in it. Just saves a
hell of a lot of time. I hated stuff written in it already. Removes my
ability to quickly read the code and adapt it to my needs. There is no
such thing as a "quick change" in any Java code base. And we all know
what the unnecessary complexity and verbosity of the language have
caused with the Log4j (double) failures.
