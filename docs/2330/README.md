# OutdoorIRL falls on its face, thank God

OutdoorIRL (the idiotic YouTube channel and authoritarian "community") is dead, thank God.

There hasn't been any new content in OutdoorIRL in all of 2023. Looks like a horrible idea finally collapsed. The entire premise of "whitelisting" is entirely brain-dead. It completely discounts the reality of variety streaming, you know, the most important innovation in all of live streaming, ever. I could never be "whitelisted" according to their criteria because I include coworking content, educational content, and regularly do product reviews even though I do five fucking hours of 100% bona fide "outdoor IRL" streaming every fucking day. I also refuse to manage multiple different channels categorizing all of it (one for outdoor IRL, one for art shows, one for education, one for DJing, one for gaming, one for random dancing, one for book club). That's how stupid the entire concept of breaking out the "real outdoor IRL streamers" from variety streamers has always been. I am *so* glad this project failed miserably. Hopefully, it will send a clear message to anyone else with such stupid ideas about what streaming is.

I had the same stupidity with that asshole who refused to list my channel under the "hackers" category. These idiots just don't understand streaming *at all* (but love to feel important by making exclusionary, authoritative lists of people they personally approve, as pathetic as that is).

Instead of approval by a now dead self-proclaimed "authority" on what "outdoor IRL" streaming is (from someone who doesn't even fucking stream at all). I'll take the many compliments like one just last Friday during adhoc coverage of a live pub band jamming, after biking 50km earlier that day, and doing a SKILSTAK Beginner Boost on that same day.

> This is the most diverse, amazing Twitch stream I have ever seen.

*That's* my goal, not to make some pathetic list of "awesome" streamers.
