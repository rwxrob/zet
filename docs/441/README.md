# Put It All on GitHub

There's something not only convenient but very compelling about putting
all your work on one service rather than strew about several "profile"
web sites. This is particularly true now that I maintain my Zettelkasten
repos there. When someone discovers you, they discover *all* of you in a
way that they can both search and follow (yes there's an RSS commit feed
for those who want it). And yes, Google prioritizes content found on
GitHub as well as includes it in any searching. All this comes for free
just because you chose to host on GitHub instead of managing some other
extra web site you might have to SEO promote in some way to even be seen
by anything else.
