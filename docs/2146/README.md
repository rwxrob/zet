# Stop saying GNU/Linux ("GNU slash Linux")

Nothing says, "I have no fucking idea what I'm talking about" more than calling Linux "GNU slash Linux".

There was a time with Stallman's gang had something significant to offer justifying the "GNU/Linux" name but those days are long gone. These days using that old moniker is downright disrespectful to the millions of lines of code and developers from hundreds of other projects besides the GNU project. Linux has come to mean everything that is involved with Linux including the X project and so many others. Giving GNU special treatment is no longer appropriate.
