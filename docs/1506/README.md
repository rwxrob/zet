# Portable Batch System (PBS) for Machine Learning

Machine learning naturally lends itself architecturally to a batch
processing model, not microservices (which can be useful for providing
visibility and observability).

The most powerful batch processing system in the world, which was
created by NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) division originally, is
the entirely proprietary (Altair) Portable Batch System (PBS). Every
large-scale enterprise should at least be considering where PBS fits in.
But, my god, is it expensive.

There is a FOSS alternative, however. https://openpbs.org
