# The `<time>` Element is *NOT* Supported in Lynx

I yelled a lot about a blog not having a date thinking it was behind
JavaScript and it turned out to be the web author was properly using the
`<time>` semantic HTML element exactly as it should be. This was
legitimately a bug in HTML compatibility in `lynx` (which is rare). By
the way, both `w3m` and `elinks` gets this correct meaning that `w3m` is
more standards compliant in addition to being easier for beginners to
master. (But I still prefer `lynx` formatting).

what I did.
