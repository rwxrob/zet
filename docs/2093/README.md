# Okay, Python is back

As much as Python and I have had history in the past, all of the main reasons that I stopped loving it are largely and maturely addressed these days (sort of).

* PIP *finally* unifies all the competing packaging systems.
* Containers make Python Virtual Environments unnecessary.
* Containers make single, compiled binary less important.
* Portable tools development and middleware is still better in Go.
* Bash is still best toolbox language since compatible everywhere.
* Python is proving far faster to code and deploy than Go.
* Strict typing is really only important on bigger projects.
* Python is not Typescript (thank God).
* Python is getting huge surge in adoption from ML and Ops people.
