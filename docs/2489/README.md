# Wrong about KEG

The fundamental principle that knowledge exchange should be done by updating a pulled, moment-in-time copy of someone's knowledge (a KEG site, like git repos) is fundamentally flawed in a world that chooses—often deliberately—to use outdated versions of that knowledge. It is better to provide only a singular source of that knowledge and make it as difficult as possible to copy it, tracking all copies if possible. This includes blocking all archiving mechanisms and AI bot consumption.

I'm getting rid of my zettelkasten as a git repo and instead adding password access to it associated with a verifiable email address. I want to know who's looking at it and when so I can thwart abuse.

Recently I had to deal with people using my outdated KEG content in my zettelkasten and blog posts to misrepresent me. This is the danger of making any thoughts or ideas public in writing. Once it is on the Internet it lives on forever. Sometimes that's a good thing, but very often it is horrible.

Imagine if people judged me by what I wrote in my private journals when I was nine years old, or even my zettelkasten entries made in a moment of passion not even a year ago. I don't feel that way today. So is there value in understanding how I felt in that moment and why? I believe there is. But it comes with a very dangerous risk.

These days people don't care about properly representing facts of any kind. They pick and choose whatever they want to make their case and have no problem at all throwing people (like me) under the bus to justify their conclusions. The debate about whether humans have always lacked the required civil respect for differing opinions during the era or correspondence but it was just not as readily apparent because we don't have examples of it now is something we can do another day. (Spoiler alert: humans have always been horrible, biased, monsters.)
