# SKILSTAK Beginner Boost 2023 - Week 3

This week we learn why Ubuntu Linux matters most, setup an Ubuntu Linux container image using podman command and apt package manager, learn how to save (commit) an image copy so we have backups during our setup, how to mount a local directory so we can share files between our running container and the host operating system, and how to navigate the command line.
