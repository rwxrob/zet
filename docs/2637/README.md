# Starlink Mini power: recharge every third night

So testing shows that Starlink Mini burns one 30,000 mAh 65w power brick ever three hours (or so). To livestream an entire typical three-day, two-night bikepacking trip (32 hours) would require roughly ten bricks (not counting the two needed for the Belabox and modem). That's 18 lbs of batteries just for the Starlink if I want to livestream every second of the trip. It would take six hours to recharge those batteries doing four at a time. So assuming I'm sleeping someplace with a power outlet every third night, I'm golden.

This is still monumentally better than the Starlink Gen3 with the Jackery Pro 1000 Explorer which would have only provided about 12 hours of livestreaming before needing a recharge and weighing 32 lbs just for the battery, and another 22 lbs for the trailer to haul it. That doesn't even count the weight of the AC adapter and router (another 10 lbs). This did allow streaming, but required I be someplace to recharge the battery every day (instead of every third day).
