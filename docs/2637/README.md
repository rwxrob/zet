# Starlink Mini power

So testing shows that Starlink Mini burns one 30,000 mAh 65w power brick ever three hours (or so). To livestream an entire typical three-day, two-night bikepacking trip (32 hours) would require roughly ten bricks (not counting the two needed for the Belabox and modem). That's 18 lbs of batteries just for the Starlink if I want to livestream every second of the trip. It would take six hours to recharge those batteries doing four at a time.
