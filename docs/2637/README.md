# Starlink Mini power

So testing shows that Starlink Mini burns one 30,000 mAh 65w power brick ever three hours (or so). To livestream an entire typical three-day, two-night bikepacking trip would require roughly ten bricks (not counting the two needed for the Belabox and modem).

32 hours of power
