# Perl is Best for Rapid Prototyping

I continue to find Perl the best shell scripting language for really
rapid prototyping to work out how a tool will be used, what are the
commands, how will it use tab completion, what is the usage information.

Then later, I can rewrite it in Go (if needed).

POSIX shell is actually a horrible prototyping language because it is so
incredibly limited. In fact, I'm going back to limiting my POSIX shell
to only stuff that might one day long on a BusyBox system. It's just way
too limited for rapid prototyping.
