# Recipe: recovery drink

* 2 scoops [Orgain protein](https://amzn.to/4781kY5) (1 serving)
* 1 scoop [Electrolyte Recovery Plus](https://amzn.to/3FSy8rY)
* 1 tbsp [light corn syrup](https://amzn.to/3QSyRjk) (not high fructose)

I *hate* how much companies like Tailwind gouge out of their unknowing customers. This recovery recipe has almost the exact ingredients of [Tailwind Recovery Mix](https://amzn.to/3uckdut) but costs more than 20 times less. Not everyone is going to like the taste of this but it has the same fruity but also salty and chocolaty taste of Tailwind.

Also, this is *recovery* (not performance) which means that you take it in immediately after a workout when your body is primed to recover best.

I also do some amount of recovery drink before bed to give my body something to work with all night while it builds everything as I sleep. It's mellow enough on my stomach to not cause night-time indigestion and such that would come from eating a meal too close to bedtime. If fact, it's kinda good with hot water before bed as a cozy nightcap.
