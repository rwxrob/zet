# What do you think of "hate speech"?

I don't believe "hate speech" should be defined or codified into law at
all (even though it very much is in the United States). Do people say
hateful, horrible things? Absolutely.

Language is complicated and fluid. This makes it impossible to
legislate. One person's "hate" is another person's "passionate
rhetoric." The swastika means prosperity and good luck to some, genocide
to others. The "N" word (which I cannot write here) is a colloquial term
for a close friend to one and a moniker for murderers to others. Even
the innocuous word "damn" is considered "harassment" to some.

I think we should re-focus all the misguided attention and resources on
creating laws defining "hate speech" into sponsoring and building tools
and methods that give individuals and families final control over their
own exposure to *any* speech whatsoever. Then *they* can decide, not
some agenda-drive or oligarch.
