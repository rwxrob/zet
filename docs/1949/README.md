# !rep rwxrob.tv

😎 You have {target.rep}.

The `!rep` command is to check your community value points. While we are always tweaking the actual values, the idea is to create a point system that accurately measures the value of any community member based on their participation and help. Here are the current values:

* 5/5 minutes (even in IRC)
* 20/5 minutes if chat detected
* 100 sub
* 20 host
* 20 raid
* 20 donation

Most points will come from exceptional things done during the stream and I'll give them out right there (usually 1000), like helping us get past something that is blocking us or making us laugh hysterically.

Please don't abuse the system.
