# Fuck it, I'm setting 20% trainer difficulty for races

Recently I got owned by someone putting out 30% less watts than me because they were lighter and had their trainer difficult virtually off. They won every sprint but were spinning 90rpm going up steep hills. Racing in Zwift just isn't fun with random people unless you "cheat" by turning trainer difficultly way down (like they are all doing).

Not all watts are created equal, a fact that so many dismiss in Zwift. In fact, watts themselves as a measure of effort are wildly wrong for people over 50.

Low RPM watts are significantly harder on the body and more difficult to recover from and maintain. This is obvious to anyone with actual endurance sports experience, but beginners seem to still not get it. It amazes me that this is something we even have to discuss.

There is no “fair” racing in Zwift, period. My Wahoo KICKR Bike has zero power loss in the drive train compared to other trainers. Am I cheating? What about when I race at 100% trainer difficulty with only a 36-30 to face 12% race hill grade? What about when I lose all the sprints to someone who is spinning 95 RPM up that hill at the same speed as me just a minute later? Am I cheating if I drop my trainer difficulty to 20% (like I’m hearing everyone does)? What about beginners on cheaper virtual bikes who haven’t earned their Tron bike yet? What about steering (now)? This is why Olympic Esport cycling goes to such lengths to ensure the equipment is similar.

In a very real way, Zwift is pay-to-win (like buying better heroes and gear in other video games). Zwift is also pain-to-win because the more time you put in the better chance you have of winning for lots of reasons that have zero to do with fitness at all.

Then there is body weight. Even if people are honest, why should lighter people go faster? There’s no fucking gravity! I would love an option to compete only based on pure watts without weight so I could DESTROY those toothpicks that would snap an Ulna if they brushed their teeth too briskly. It’s virtual, so why the hell not?

All I can say is THANK GOD people cannot hide their RPMs during a race. Nothing gives away someone who has a low trainer difficulty setting, or is racing on a triple, or whatever else, then seeing them spinning away on 10+% grades. I’m like, “aha, okay, I see you now.” I’m free to judge them and them me. It’s (friendly) competition after all.

I do wish RPM at every second was recorded for Zwift Power. That will easily allow everyone to weed out those who weren't actually competing with the same equipment even though nothing is wrong with changing your equipment for a race, like in real life. Hell, I’d love to follow people who are committed to riding the same equipment on group rides so it all feels more accurate. That’s really the only way to have good, accurate fun competition.

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. On random races, I've recently decided to just fuck it and set my trainer difficulty to 20% (or even lower) like everyone else and stop feeling guilty about it. Normally I’m 100% because I enjoy the hills and reality on my hydraulic KICKR bike, but it’s not worth getting dropped on a competitive 40km with rolling hills because I actually feel them and no one else does. They sure don't care. Why should I?
