# Fat pants falling off of me

I bought these 34s and 33s and they won't stay up now, which is a good thing. Since February 2023 I've lost 12 kilos. I started dropping a lot more recently after moving to slow, long bike rides instead of doing the intervals before. I suspect a lot of that weight is muscle, but its fine. A lot of fat going with it. I'm happy to report my man-boobs are gone.
