## Windows Remote Desktop breaks sound

Something about using Windows Remote Desktop breaks the sound devices and stops them from appearing at all. Strangely, just logging into the local system at its physical location fixes it. This immediately had me looking for alternatives. RealVNC turns out to be the solution.


## Never coming back to this apartment

I'm outta here. Once my stuff is all in the storage unit I'm never coming back to this apartment, ever. I'll do my Beginner Boost live stream from the road (car or bike) and perhaps even a few streams from my storage unit, which I will probably make up all nice. It's become my happy place when I'm not on the road. I have plenty of power from batteries for an evening of streaming. All I need is to have this streaming computer sitting in the corner of wherever my step-son has his mandatory Internet access. (That's one thing I can absolutely count on.)
