I affirm the existence of a power greater than myself that I can turn to when my own actions feel inadequate.

I recognize one purpose of life on which we can all agree is to promote harmony and balance between all living things such that all may learn and grow during their brief time on Earth.

I acknowlege free will and that not all people must live as I do and that a power greater than myself will correct any imbalances and abuses, sometimes with my help, but not always.

I will actively fight for the freedom all people *must* have to live as they see fit provided their lives do not restrict that same freedom for others.

I will lift those around me by sharing my skills, knowledge, and abilities without fear or hording and pay forward that which others have given me.

I will live an authentic, ethical life free from unnecessary violence, deception, gossip, and perception management.

I will chanel anger, frustation, and sadness into ethical action. I recognize that *ethical* action and *legal* action are not always the same.

I will honor my body as the most precious gift of life and prioritize taking care of it as such.

I will only take which I need and leave the rest for others recognizing a power greater than myself will provide when needed.
