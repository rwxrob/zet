# Changes to streaming and publishing

* More GoPro YouTube videos edited from content that cannot be streamed.
* Create a "video blogging" category on YouTube.
* Realized Twitch is about entertainment and feeling company with others.
* Running outside will *not* be on stream.
* Moving to trail running with little or no suburbs around (to trigger me).
* Decided *not* to run on Zwift pretty much at all.
* Decided to do *most* cycling indoors.

Continue (by percentage time):

* Mostly community, coworking streams (cozy, music, meals, Frisbee with Sam).
* Zwift cycling.
* Video blogging.
* Cycling steams (urban, suburbs, farmland, etc.).
* Overwatch and occasional Dota 2.
* Adhoc, productive, respectful dialog with friends.
* Art streams (but more focused and short).
