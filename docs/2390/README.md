# Living out of car (Subaru Outback) is unsustainable

After some initial testing, I've made a tough and unexpected conclusion about living out of my car. It simply cannot be done safely and easily for a long period of time---especially by someone who is a very active athlete who needs a solid base from which to recover and launch daily adventures. Others on YouTube have done (and continue) to do it, but they don't have the requirements that I do.

* Recovery after long or tough bike rides is crucial to my daily life.

* Recovery is hampered by not being able to get excellent sleep.

* Allergies, though seasonal, destroy good sleep and health.

* Side sleeping on hard surfaces is uncomfortable because hip bones poke through foam and create hot spots that get soar really quickly. End up waking less rested and sometimes with new soarness because of muscles strained. No car bed or mat will ever be as good as an actual mattress---especially as I get older.

* More likely to cramp up and be unable to deal with cramps when they happen.

* Stomach sleeping is impossible since shin bones bruise as feet dangle off edge.

* Could put board down, but that makes "office mode" impossible.

* Need to deal with insects trapped inside car.

* Need to promote fresh air flow since stale air does not circulate as it would in a home even with all the windows open.

* More risk of air pollution inside the car as within a bad apartment (mold, allergens, chemicals, etc.) except there is no good way to remove this from the air through use of filter or something while the car is not moving. Sleeping outside in a tent would be much healthier long term since the tent can be cleaned of allergens, insects can be kept out better, and the air is always fresh.

* A car cannot be thoroughly cleaned easily once a week like an apartment could be. This contributes to the air pollution inside the car making long-term sleeping and living inside of it unhealthy.

* Peeing into a pee bottle is *really* annoying from a laying or sitting position in a cramped vehicle, not something I want to do every day, several times a day.

* Going number two is impossible from the car. Even if I took out the passenger side front seat and added a small porta-potty I wouldn't have the room for it.

* Having my own urine or extrement stored in the cab of the car for even a short amount of time is completely unbearable and would blow my ability to sleep or concentrate. It is also just an accident waiting to happen in such closed quarters.

* Making an outdoor bathroom with a privacy tent requires staying in places where that is possible. But the weather will inevitably not allow me to go outside to use it. Urban car camping is possible in stealth mode, but setting anything up outside of the car blows car camping away. Living in a stealthy van or RV even would be sustainable because you don't have to do anything outside. But then you lose your mobility since driving one around is much harder.

* Living out of car means being stranded in it on very weathery days. Spending more than a few hours---even for a coder---is extremely uncomfortable. Getting out and going for a walk to stretch is not always possible depending on the weather outside and the location.

* Working only from a laptop is challenging after a person has become used to multiple monitors and a home lab of computers to work with.

* There is simply no option where I take a shower after a ride meaning I will immediately dirty all my gear after only a single hard ride.  This can be gotten around by washing the bedding/bag every week. But that means finding and paying for a laundromat weekly. Washing bedding could be done outside, but not during months of incliment weather.

* Staying fit depends entirely on the weather. Having an apartment means I can do stuff indoors or at the gym to stay healthy when it is horrible outside. This is not possible when living from a car. Even if I got a gym membership I would have to stay someplace within walking distance to that gym regularly and normally that is not allowed.

* In general, living from a car *requires* good weather, which limits the number of places that I could even visit and requires I change locations frequently throughout the year.

* Living in a car carries a lot of hidden expenses that apartment renters don't have. Gasoline and car maintenance alone are hugely expensive. It's all the little trips to get to places to stay that add up more than driving to a destination from an apartment for an adventure on the weekend ever would.
