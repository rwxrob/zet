# Living out of car (Subaru Outback) is unsustainable

After some initial testing, I've made a tough and unexpected conclusion about living out of my car. It simply cannot be done safely and easily for a long period of time.

* Recovery after long or tough bike rides is crucial to my daily life.

* Recovery is hampered by not being able to get excellent sleep.

* Allergies, though seasonal, destroy good sleep and health.

* Side sleeping on hard surfaces is uncomfortable because hip bones poke through foam and create hot spots that get soar really quickly. End up waking less rested and sometimes with new soarness because of muscles strained. No car bed or mat will ever be as good as an actual mattress---especially as I get older.

* More likely to cramp up and be unable to deal with cramps when they happen.

* Stomach sleeping is impossible since shin bones bruise as feet dangle off edge.

* Could put board down, but that makes "office mode" impossible.

* Need to deal with insects trapped inside car.

* Need to promote fresh air flow since stale air does not circulate as it would in a home even with all the windows open.

* Just as much risk of air pollution inside the car as within a bad apartment (mold, allergens, etc.) except there is no good way to remove this from the air through use of filter or something. Sleeping outside in a tent would be much healthier long term since the tent can be cleaned of allergens.

* A car cannot be thoroughly cleaned easily once a week like an apartment could be.
