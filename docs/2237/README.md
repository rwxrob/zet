# Back to Linux Mint Desktop

I'm giving Linux desktop yet another chance. While I do think the Boost should focus on getting a Linux virtual machine on Mac or Windows to get started (since need to learn that anyway). I do love having Linux on the desktop and always have. I had it at IBM for 10 years. And I started streaming for the first two years with it.

Mint has never done me wrong, in 20 years. I'm hoping that QEMU/KVM have come along enough to do all the emulation I could ever need, and I have a VMware Workstation Pro license if needed. It's just a matter of time before I hit things that are buggy, I've already lost four hours over night just futzing with a bunch of small stuff to get it to where Windows is by default. But I have remembered some very important things that it brings back:

* Overall, everything is a *lot* faster
* Identical web cam is *much* clearer and has less lag
* Open web browser directly from Lynx when needed
* Full YouTube clips library (great for streaming)
* Can use `mvlast` and all my utilities that integrate with GUI browser
* My keyboard sound control keys suddenly work
* Can use `virsh` and `podman` directly without need to login to server
* Can run graphics applications that have been containerized (like Zwift)
* No broken virtual network emulation breaking DNS and other routing
* No completely idiotic WSL to blow the fuck up

I have notice the screen tearing in OBS is back. I know there is a deep-magic fix for it in the NVIDIA tools (which tool a while just to get to work).

On reboot, OBS reverts to different sound source (like it did before).
