# Writing is better than streaming or vlogging

While it is true that videos and images give a real sense of the moment, a more complete sense is only gained through thoughtful reflection on that moment in words. After all, thoughts are conveyed by words when the image cannot capture it.

I also enjoy writing way better than making selfy videos. I realize there is only a small fraction of the human population that still reads anything recreationally today, but I'm still a part of that population. I appreciate good cinemaphotography and videography but value thoughts conveyed by images created in the mind of the reader far more where the canvas is unlimited to anyone who wants to paint there---particularly when music is added.
