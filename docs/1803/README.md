# ðŸ’¡ Create branch from `git stash branch BRANCH STASH`

Thanks to Winter Swallow for this tip. This is great when you get busy making changes on something only to realize you were on the wrong branch and now need to do other work there. In the past usually I would discard the stash or just move it out with the intent of getting to it later and then never making it. This way the stash can become part of something to be added later and the initial work is not lost.
