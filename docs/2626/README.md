# GDMBR is the DNB baseline

The Great Divide Mountain Bike Route provides the greatest variety providing the best possible gear list to carry while living on the bike as a digital nomad:

* Alpine weather conditions with occasional freezing temperatures
* Desert heat weather conditions with occasional 100+ days
* Regular 7+% grades
* Fording river crossings
* Sharing an office (and bathroom) with bears and critters
* Filtering own water

Extreme weather is the exception rather than the rule, but being prepared for it is a matter of survival for anyone attempting to live and work while perpetually bike touring (even with an SOS button).

Preparing a gear list that will cover all of this *plus* allow 40 solid hours of professional work every week is the perfect target. Here's the extra work gear needed:

* Starlink Mini
* Quick mount
* 6xBaseus 65w battery bricks
* USB-C to barrel adapter
* Fast-charging recharging brick (1.37 lbs, 4x100w charging)
* 2x laptops w/long-life battery (work/personal) (1 if you can)

Having the fastest possible charging is way more important than attempting to lug around any solar power options. In less an hour, all the power needed for three days and two nights is topped off on all the devices. If this is done daily, the time is even less. This grants an effective range of "no resources" to whatever can be covered in three days (which, is coincidently, the maximum anyone would want to go without a water resource anyway).

Live streamers have quite a bit more to lug around:

* Orange Pi Plus
* 2x DJI Pocket 3
* 2x DJI Mic 2
* 2x Neatgear Nighthawk M6 (no batteries, one backup)
* 65w Baseus battery bank
