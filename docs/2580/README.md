# Windows Remote Desktop breaks sound

Something about using Windows Remote Desktop breaks the sound devices and stops them from appearing at all. Strangely, just logging into the local system at its physical location fixes it. This       immediately had me looking for alternatives. RealVNC turns out to be the solution.
