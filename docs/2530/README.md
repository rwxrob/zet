# Live streaming copyrighted music

* Just got my first strike on YouTube
* Digital restreaming seems to trigger YouTube more than others
* What about JBL speakers during IRL?
* Streaming to track 2 does not get added to VOD on Twitch (only)
* Restreaming to multiple streams negates that advantage
* YouTube, Facebook, Twitter have no track 2 VOD negation
* Kick automatically saves VODs (no way to stop)
* Hundreds of DJs and musicians stream copyrighted music regularly to Twitch/Kick
* One main rule of Twitch/Kick copyright music streaming: THOU SHALT NOT SAVE VOD!
* YouTube will *never* be a viable, leading live-streaming platform
* Only one song at a time
