# üêß Homelab `init` on Saturdays

Four days into 2023 and I'm realizing that I seriously omitted something from my resolutions and schedule. I have to schedule time weekly to work on the homelab, clean the room, and so forth. This was also one of the most popular video playlists I've ever done. Now that I have the IRL rig working consistently and the extension cables for covering the room even without the IRL rig, I'm kinda setup perfectly to start again.

I also noticed that if I don't do something with it every week that I begin to forget where I left off on the homelab projects I have going. This will cover all the stuff that needs attention even if it isn't a top priority:

* Linux
* Hardware
* Containers
* Kubernetes
* Networking
* Security
* Ansible

This will include creating video record of how I created by Belabox so I can help save people the hassle of buying one of those overpriced, custom milled kits.

I can consider this Saucha as far as my yoga practice goes (since there is no Asana on Saturdays).
