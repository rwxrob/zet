# Starlink mini is best bikepacking setup

After learning about the USB-C to barrel DC adapter it has become overwhelmingly clear that the Starlink Mini is the new preferred way to bikepack and livestream. The biggest reason is that this setup *does not require a trailer* so long as the streamer plans on recharging the battery bank fully when reprovisioning about every two days (assuming eight hours of streaming per day) then the following is all that is needed:

* Starlink mini mounted and raised from rear rack (2.5 lbs)
* 3x 72000 mAh battery bank (2.8 lbs, about 9 hours streaming for each)
* USB-C to barrel adapter (https://a.co/d/hanp6fM) (0.1 lbs)
* Some sort of solid clamp mount (4 lbs)

That's roughly 15 lbs for all the gear needed to get Starlink instead of the over 40 lbs of gear needed with the Gen3 dish (not counting the 22 lbs for the trailer itself to carry it). That's 50 lbs less to pull on the bike!
