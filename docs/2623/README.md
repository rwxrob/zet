# Starlink mini is best bikepacking setup

After learning about the USB-C to barrel DC adapter it has become overwhelmingly clear that the Starlink Mini is the new preferred way to bikepack and livestream. The biggest reason is that this setup *does not require a trailer* so long as the streamer plans on recharging the battery bank fully when reprovisioning about every two days (assuming eight hours of streaming per day) then the following is all that is needed:

* Starlink mini mounted and raised from rear rack
* 50000 mAh 20V (1 kWh, 16 hours) battery bank
* USB-C to barrel adapter (https://a.co/d/hanp6fM)
* Some sort of mount
