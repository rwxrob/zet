# Robert Sapolsky, I Wanna Read Everything from Him

Just recently learned about Robert Sapolsky. His work is centralized on
how stress affects cognition and can damage the brain. OMG, I cannot get
his books to me fast enough. My brain has been so fucked up by stress.
To the point where I even have a tick (almost like Tourette's) when
unpleasant stressors enter my brain. At night with my wife before I fall
asleep, my whole body ticks every five minutes until I doze off,
fighting off the intense thoughts of anxiety about completely irrational
worries. (Thank God for my wife, who is also crazy in her own wonderful
way.) All of this started after I got unplugged from the Mormons (and
all the drama that ensued).

>    devastating consequences to your health, he said: "If you turn on
>    the stress response chronically for purely psychological reasons,
>    you increase your risk of adult onset diabetes and high blood
>    pressure. If you're chronically shutting down the digestive system,
>    there's a bunch of gastrointestinal disorders you're more at risk
>    for as well."

I guess I just want to understand the Swiss cheese that is now my brain
because of all this. It has created a new me that didn't exist before,
not a bad me, just a different one. Before I was a master of
self-deception and perception management, wearing my khakis and living
more than just a double life. Like every Mormon, there was me, and there
was the me that I presented to the world. Not anymore. I'm just me now,
one, authentic, broken, asshole-y, passionate, sometimes kind, me.
People either like that person or they don't. I'm working on my own
progress in my own way, but if someone doesn't like it, FUCK 'EM! That
is there problem, not mine. There are plenty of people and jobs in the
world that are just fine with WHO I AM and I will not return to any
level of behavior other than that.

Time to get reading Sapolsky to understand myself better.
