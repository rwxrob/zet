# Use G navigation in lynx to jump to bottom of long (dumb) sites

So many completely bad web sites --- including the official Kubernetes documentation site --- have gawd-awful menus and navigation bars that are 90% of the text content of a page (and cannot be skipped, which we could if they had a clue about good Web design). Instead, the way to save yourself is to jump to the end immediately and then back up a page a time:

* G - to get to the bottom
* Control-P - to page up (N is page down)
