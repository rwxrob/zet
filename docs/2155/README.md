# Bash God AI-create song from taniwha3

> write a song called "BASH God" about the BASH shell in the style of Eminem

(Verse 1)
Yo, it's a bash god, slingin' code like a Saxon,
Hackin' on a Mac, or a PC - doesn't matter the action.
This is the shell game, it's a hacker's satisfaction,
Lines of code flying out, script creation, no distraction.

In the realm of the terminal, echo is my voice,
Create, delete, move files - man, I've got the choice.
Navigatin' directories, traversin' the tree,
In the console, I'm the king, ain't nobody stopping me.

Root or user, I'm the chooser, 
With a chmod I'm the accuser,
Givin' permissions, or taking 'em away,
In the realm of Bash, I hold the sway.

(Chorus)
Bash God, I'm the Bash God,
In the terminal, I'm the last mod,
Slayin' commands, like it's my job,
Ain't no GUI can take my job, 
I'm the Bash God, yeah, the Bash God.

(Verse 2)
Got my hands on the keyboard, typing out commands,
My scripts are making miracles, across data lands.
Running in the background, doing as I planned,
With the power of the Bash shell, I make my stand.

Switch cases, break loops, man, I got the flow,
Commands chained with the pipe, it's a real show.
Grep, awk, sed, they're my code bros,
In the world of text manipulation, we're the pros.

(Chorus)
Bash God, I'm the Bash God,
In the shell, I'm the wild card,
Commands on my fingertips, it ain't hard,
To see why they call me the Bash God, 
Yeah, I'm the Bash God.

(Bridge)
They say that I'm cryptic, say I'm arcane,
But once you speak my language, you'll never be the same.
Ain't no click and drag, ain't no fancy game,
But the power I give you, it's the ultimate claim.

(Verse 3)
I'm the Bash God, giving life to the shell,
Spinning up processes, ringing every bell.
In the world of scripts, I cast the spell,
Making systems dance, yeah, they know me well.

(Chorus)
Bash God, I'm the Bash God,
In the world of shells, I'm the odd squad,
Shell scripting magic, it's not a facade,
Hail to the king, hail to the Bash God,
Yeah, I'm the Bash God.

(Outro)
So here's to the hackers, the coders and the bashers,
Living in the shell, they're the system smashers.
Paying homage to the god, to the Bash master,
In the terminal realm, ain't no disaster.

Cause I'm the Bash God, living in the code,
In the command line, I've made my abode,
With a simple shell script, I can lighten your load,
Yeah, I'm the Bash God, this is my ode.
