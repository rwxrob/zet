# GitHub GUI Commits (Pages, etc.) are Annoying

I follow a pretty strict Git process lately so when I realized I had
merge conflicts because I opted to click on the GitHub Pages stuff
(against my better judgement) and noticed the GitHub decided to commit
directly to `main`, well, it pissed me off. Perhaps this note will
prevent others from the same problem. Just don't do *anything* on GitHub
that would alter your main branch. Sometimes it isn't completely
obvious, however, so you might have to do a little research before doing
it on anything you are about. Nothing was destructive, just additive in
a way that forced me to to more merge fixing than I would have liked.
