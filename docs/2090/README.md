# Stung by bee on 50 kph descent in traffic

Yesterday my ride was cut short (by about four hours, an hour of which I made up on Zwift at home) after a bee smacked me in exactly between my eyebrows and got caught between my sunshade sunglasses (which go over my actual glasses) and my helmet. I managed to keep the bike from crashing while ripping stuff off my face with one hand, but if I had been anywhere near the shoulder I would have gone down because of the swerving I was doing. Without being able to see I came out of the bottom of the hill and found a tiny place to pull over. Cars continued to speed past me doing 60 mph (in a 45 mph) taking kids home from the extremely radical Christian "Liberty" private school, mostly overpriced, idiotic Lexus SUVs, jeeps, and trucks with a bed any *actual* farmer would laugh at (no surprise there). I manages to call my wife while my eyebrow throbbed. I was no where she could pick me up, no room. So I got off the phone and started to Davidson where I could have her come get me in the Harris Teeter parking lot. Despite the pain, I was really lucky I haven't developed any allergic reaction to bee stings in my old age. (It would have forced my wife to give herself an epipen shot.) I was a little panicked that the venom might have spread to my eye itself. I was super glad that the bee didn't actually sting my eye, which was a very real possibility.
