# Facebook fails again: yarn is far inferior to npm in 2023

I cannot believe I've realizing this only now. The `yarn` project (from Facebook) sort of shamed NPM into doing a lot of the right things, but `yarn` today is an absolute fucking joke. Stay the hell away from it. Use `npm` even if it sucks as well, at least it has an `apt install npm` installer.
