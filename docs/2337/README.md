# No more driving streams (unless driving is the point)

I've decided to no longer stream the car drives to and from the outdoor IRL streams. Here's a summary of the reasons:

* Driving is usually just boring traffic jams and ranting.
* Anything I would say on the drive I can say on the bike or walk.
* Burns a full hour of bandwidth for no reason (35 minutes each way).
* Better thumbnails when beginning on the bike and ending at sunset.
* Better final vibe, leaving on a high point.
* Let's me raid a music or coworking streamer after end of daytime stream.
