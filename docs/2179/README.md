# Need to look at source of bounca.org to learn certs

<https://www.bounca.org/> looks like a nice project with a very clean approach to managing the most common type of certs with a custom root CA and intermediate CAs. Just reading that code should create quite a solid understanding of what actually goes into the certs (without needing to deal with `openssl.cnf` files).
