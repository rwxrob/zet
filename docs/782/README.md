# The Obsidian "Tool" Does NOT Follow Zettelkasten

It's a fucking sham. First of all you have to "point" it at directory.
But it also has it's own non-standard variation of Markdown. Also, it
does not allow you to capture a zettel inside a single directory so that
other things can be attached to the zettel. Plus it even gets unique
identifiers wrong. It's absolute shit.
