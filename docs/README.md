# KEG Zettelkasten for Muhlestein, Robert S. (rwxrob)

Hi I'm Rob. This is my personal **zettelkasten** KEG site. It contains stuff on pretty much any topic I feel like writing about. The latest additions and changes are always [indexed](dex/changes).

Note that the nature of a Zettelkasten is to be messy and unedited full of information that might once have been relevant or true or written in a moment of passion and now is no longer how I feel or even completely inaccurate. This is not a "blog" or "site" or publication of any kind. Failure to keep this in mind when reading *any* zettelkasten can result in harm to owner and others. *Never* cite anything from this or any other zettelkasten. Instead, use it to inspire your own research and conclusions.

This is to protect me by allowing me to control the content and not have anything I have written taken out of context or used to misrepresent me.***
