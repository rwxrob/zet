# KEG Zettelkasten for Muhlestein, Robert S. (rwxrob)

Hi I'm Rob. This is my personal **zettelkasten** KEG site. It contains stuff on pretty much any topic I feel like writing about. The latest additions and changes are always [indexed](dex/changes).

Note that the nature of a Zettelkasten is to be messy and unedited full of information that might once have been relevant or true or written in a moment of passion and now is no longer how I feel or even completely inaccurate. This is not a "blog" or "site" or publication of any kind. Failure to keep this in mind when reading *any* zettelkasten can result in harm to owner and others. *Never* cite anything from this or any other zettelkasten. Instead, use it to inspire your own research and conclusions.

***NOTICE: This is not "open" content. It is illegal to copy anything from this zettelkasten or web site for purpose that is not guaranteed under American "fair use" copyright law. Violators will be prosecuted. This is to protect myself from people misrepresenting me, quoting me out of context, and just generally being horrible people. I'm very serious about prosecution. I will find you and ensure you receive the consequences you deserve if you abuse this content.***
