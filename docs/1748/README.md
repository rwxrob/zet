# ðŸ¤¦ "I won't use Ubuntu 'cuz snap"

Ubuntu server is by far and away the largest Linux distribution in the container world. You are more likely to encounter an Ubuntu container image than *any* other (including Alpine, which I love) and RedHat (which is a favorite for hosting VMs and Kubernetes nodes and such).

So this begs the question, why on Earth would you write off the most significant distribution in the cloud-native space because of a stupid fucking decision with snap?

Don't get me wrong. I fucking *hate* snap. It is one of the worst designs to come from any company claiming to be associated with Linux. But, my god, don't shoot yourself in the foot over it. Just don't use it.

And yes, I fucking *love* Alpine. It is by far my favorite Linux distribution even though I don't get to use it nearly as much as I would like. It is the *only* Linux distribution to be 100% free from GPLv3 shit.
