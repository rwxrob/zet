# Use Ubuntu for Workstation Image

Even though Debian seems like a good pick, I was just burned by not
being able to use one of my install scripts that depends on an Ubuntu
PPA. It doesn't matter what I think of PPA and Ubuntu, that is what
people use to distribute stuff officially, including the Git project.

This is especially true for beginners with no Linux experience, those
who might pick PopOS! as their main host OS later.

I was a little worried by the fact that Canonical announced they are no
longer supporting their "minimal" OS version, which made the container
people raise an eyebrow. But I'm sure there will continue to be official
Ubuntu images maintained in the standard Docker library. So that's what
beginners should probably use.
