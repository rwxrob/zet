# Metal Jetson Nano case sucks

I had heard about this before, but it didn't start to become a problem until this last year. Now about every fourth stream I have to dig out the SD card and take it out and then put it back in to get the rig to even boot. People have said that the extender for the SD card is the issue and I assume that's what it is.

This makes me want an Orange Pi even more since the SD card is directly connected and not extended by the case.
