# Keyboard for writing, camera for vlogging

There won't be anything replacing a keyboard for writing, ever. And nothing captures the emotion and feeling of an idea or moment more then video. It's the next best thing to being there. The written words can cover what is happening inside, that no one can see, while the video captures what can never be written.

This also means there is no place for writing from a phone. Using conversational interfaces are fine and all, but why go to the trouble when I could just make a private video instead capturing the gist of the idea or event and then use it to trigger memories to which I can add words later. Most of these quick "stories" are perfect as they are to share. This makes me happier to keep my `zet` tool as it is without the need to make entries of any kind from a phone (like Obsidian does).
