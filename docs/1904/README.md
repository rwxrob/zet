# No conference presentations in 2023, but definitely in 2024

Originally I wanted to have enough content finished to present at the regular conventions that interest me, but with the move and other priorities for 2023. I see now that is just not a reality. I'll keep on streaming, even more now that ever with the new 2023 "pomo-radio" format. Perhaps that will lead into a conference talk or two in 2024. Here are the conferences I'd consider then:

* Local Go meetup
* Local Linux meetup
* Gocon
* Twitchcon
* ISTE - "KEG" and "Twitch for Language Education"
