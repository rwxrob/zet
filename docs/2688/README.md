# OMG UTM is QEMU!

QEMU has always been amazing, but getting it to work on everything has always been the really hard part. Now I'm just learning that UTM (for Mac) is actually just really well packaged QEMU! 

This is insanely cool! QEMU does full hardware architecture emulation allowing me to run FreeBSD if I want. *You simply cannot do this with virtualisation alone!* That is so insanely cool I can't stand it---especially for doing lab stuff and live streaming and producing content to give people a view of all the different flavors of UNIX out there.

This has just completely solidified my position on Mac as the dominant platform for serious enterprise development and my number one recommendation for anyone breaking into tech. The UTM discovery combined with my recent experiences with using one-off Brew casks (so much better than APT or AUR) has made this a no-brainer for anyone paying real attention. From a Mac you can do all the other things that you need, and all the secondary stuff just works better than any other operating system in existence. Windows is shit, always has been (unless you are gaming). Linux is a constant and consistent shit-show with no sign of ever changing. (I've been watching it for more than 20 yeas at this point.)

I am just so fucking happy I did not opt for an overweight, power-sucking Linux laptop for my latest corporate "refresh."
