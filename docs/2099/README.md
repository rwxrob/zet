# Weight: 86.1 kilos (down from 93.3 Feb/3), goal still 67 kilos

Even though I weighed 83.5 kilos after my long ride four days ago, my rested and fully recovered morning (post void) weight today is the real one: 86.1 kilos.

The visual changes are obvious. When I woke I could see the loss of fat and increased muscle in my legs and arms. I can even see definition in my side abs and back. It's really fun and encouraging.  I can already wear all my expensive Patagonia gear again, which makes coffee on the patio with my wife and dog on a chilly 16C day seem like camping.

I can even do pull ups again. Did 10 yesterday just to see if I could. Couldn't even do one in February. And I've done *no* upper-body strength training at all. That became possible *just* from dropping the weight to a level that allows pull-ups to even be realistic.

It's a glorious feeling, but I have a ways to go to get to 67 kilos. I have a feeling dropping the weight will be a lot more difficult from here on out because I'm also working on building muscle and weight will remain the same while body composition shifts over because muscle weighs so much more than fat.

The average "ideal" weight is supposedly between 56 and 84 kilos with 69 being the optimal weight for an "average male" according to one source while another source says between 56 and 75.7. I feel like 67 is a healthy balance of muscle and reduced fat good for cycling. Most of that weight will be in the hill-climber legs I want to build. That will allow about 7 kilos of upper-body muscle that most cyclists don't have. That will also make climbing out of the saddle a good full-body strength workout. I'll soon start throwing in pull-ups, running, and yoga again as well. My goal is to be fit, functional, and fashionable, not competitive. I have too many other things I want to accomplish.
