# Copyrighted music is fine on Twitch if no VODs

There are literally hundreds of DJs who play copyrighted music for hours a day without any repercussions because they only do it live and never save the VODs. If Twitch were to start cracking down on them at least 30% of the Music category would cease to exist including everyone who does "by request" covers that are technically copyrighted. This is why I don't mind playing *good* (copyrighted) music while doing coworking streams.
