# Never Automatically Publish VODs!

I don't know why I never realized this before, but auto-publishing VODs
is downright stupid. There will always be something you don't want to
publish and not publishing the VOD means that you have full control over
what gets ultimately published (provided you disable clips). This means
no one go back and watch the beginning of the VOD to catch up. If you
make a mistake, just don't publish it.

Obviously, this has draw backs. For example, if you are playing a game
and want someone to clip a good play for you, you just can't. You have
to do that yourself. But the safety is more than worth it to me.

This is also not *full* protection because a really motivated
troll/hacker could simply turn on their own video capture for your whole
session or when they think you are about to screw up (at a check out
counter, etc.).
