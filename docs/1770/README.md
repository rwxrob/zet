# Q: Why don't you use Arch Linux?

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/nC_IPA7mFKc>

Because I value my time and Arch has nothing I want or need. Why does *anyone* use Arch? By the way, I *have* used Arch for building my own security/pentesting container. Arch is better than Gentoo for such things because it doesn't require compilation. Arch is horrible for beginners because they feel small because they can't get it to work. Arch is *great* if you want to truly learn Linux. Arch reminds me of *all* Linux in the 90s. Combined with Linux From Scratch (LFS), Arch can give you a solid understanding of low-level Linux. Please stop telling beginners to use Arch without understanding their needs first.

Arch Linux community is unfortunately full of a lot of "those guys" who talk down to everyone even though they really don't know shit.

In short, Arch can be very helpful to learn about Linux, but is generally a bad pick for beginners. Manjaro is especially bad having bricked my computer lab just by students clicking on the "update" button.
