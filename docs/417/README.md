# Twitch is Cheapest Option for Streaming Audio

Looked briefly into streaming through a radio service or putting up my
own server. Costs are still pretty prohibitive for more than 20
listeners simultaneously. So the best options remains Twitch, making
sure to delete the VODS as soon as you stop. Until Twitch figures out
how to track copyrighted music in live streams that is a viable (albeit
technically illegal) option. It certainly is the most ethical. What the
music industry is doing to the world with DCMA isn't fucking good for
anyone. This is one solid case where civil disobedience is the only
effective way to protest. It certainly worked to destroy the shit they
tried to do with CDs and led to the streaming revolution we have today.
So progress was made.
