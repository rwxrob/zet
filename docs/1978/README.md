# Dealing with dog and seasonal allergies

I've been fighting allergies my whole fucking life. Lately, I've been having massive attacks that make my entire body itch and ooze puss from skin sores out of nowhere on occasion. I have random, intense sneezing fits. I'm so distended from inflamed organs I don't even fit into pants that are two sizes bigger than my normal size. The worst part is that I have no fucking idea what is wrong. I've been to doctors and no one can figure it out. I am making an appointment with an allergist, if I can find one. Every time I go to the doctor for this stuff I end up with a lighter wallet and nothing to show for it.

Things I *do* know:

***I've very allergic to the dog (and her hair is everywhere).*** Here hair is short and fine and floats all over. I have found it on my keyboard, phone, sink, kitchen table, everywhere. I don't think I can live in the house with that dog any longer. But my step-son *needs* the dog so we will never be getting rid of her. I love her too much as well. But, I just cannot be in the same room as her and live to be 90, not like this.

***I'm very allergic to crape-myrtle trees.*** If I get a good dose of this it will actually shut my airway down. It's the only time I've come close to needing an epipen (which I do no use).

***Zyrtec seems to help.*** But I can never be sure. Then I read that those who use it become even more allergic if they stop taking the pills. Sounds about right.

***Flonase has helped in the past.*** Even though it is a steroid, it does work, at least it did for "hay fever" before I had a dog.
