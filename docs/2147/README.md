# 2-hour zone 2 best way to lose fat and up health

Some of the following is based on my own numbers and Strava evaluations.

* Zone 2 burns less total fat than higher intensities despite higher percentage.
* Zone 2 builds mitochondrial function better than all other intensities.
* Long and slow is better for weight loss and overall fitness improvements.
* Zone 2 uses 50-85% of calories from fat (depending on study trusted).
* Zone 2 uses 15-50% of calories from glucose.
* 90 minutes of zone 2 (for me) is about 1000 calories burned.
* 90 minutes of zone 2 is 500-850 fat calories.
* 90 minutes of zone 2 is 150-500 glucose calories.
* 90 minutes of zone 2 burns 65-110 grams fat.
* 90 minutes of zone 2 burns 38-125 grams glucose.
* Person cannot burn fat without some glucose as well.
* About 600 grams glycogen is maximum person can store (rest goes to fat).
* Theoretically, no fuel needed for zone 2 < 7 hours if glycogen full.
* Although 9 cals/fat gram, 7.7 cals to burn fat gram.
* Glucose is 4 calories per gram.
