# Click on Song Image to Jump in Spotify Playlist

Unless your Spotify has freaked out and stopped functioning properly
(which is not surprising for a piece of shit Electron app) then you just
have to click on the image of the currently playing song to jump to in
in the current playlist so you can remove it (or whatever). This is nice
after dumping a ton of songs from another playlist into yours and
listening through them all to decide which ones get to stay.
