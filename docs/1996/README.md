ðŸ“¹ I IRL stream from a Sony AS300 with ElGato Camlink on Jetson Nano 2GB running Belabox (Linux). Sometimes I GoPro as well. I have a Patagonia bike messenger bag with Stuntman and GoPro mounts for everything. Three modems (Verizon, ATT, T-Mobile) and two local wifi dongles keep me connected, which costs about 250 US dollars/month. For information about my home setup see [!rig].
