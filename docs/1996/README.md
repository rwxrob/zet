# rwxrob.tv: !irl !belabox

ðŸ“¹ I IRL stream from a Sony AS300 with ElGato Camlink on Jetson Nano 2GB running Belabox (Linux),sometimes a GoPro as well. I have a Patagonia bike messenger bag with Stuntman and GoPro mounts for everything. Three modems (Verizon/wifi, ATT/ethernet, and T-Mobile/wifi) plus two more local wifi dongles keep me connected, which costs about 250 US dollars/month. For information about my home setup see [!rig].
