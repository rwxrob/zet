# rwxrob.tv: !irl !rig !belabox

ðŸ“¹ I IRL stream from a Sony AS300 with ElGato Camlink on Jetson Nano 2GB running Belabox (Linux), pretty standard. Sometimes I GoPro as well. I have a Patagonia bike messenger bag with Stuntman mount and GoPro mounts for everything. Three modems (Verizon, ATT, T-Mobile) and two local wifi dongles keep me connected, which costs about 250 US dollars/month. Thanks for your !support.
