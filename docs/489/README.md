# Single Channel Discord FTW!

I've struggled to get Discord up and running and to be able to properly
monitor it such that it isn't abused. But I think I've found the ideal
solution (having had a community member or two recommend it): just use a
single channel with user-created threads.

This solves a bunch of problems that I'll just summarize as bullet
points:

* Easy to monitor one channel from screen during the day
* Integrates better with IRC and/or Twitch if wanted
* Allows users to create own threads instead of asking for channels
* Provides persistent place to post URLs instead of Twitch
* Allows off-line conversations to continue after Twitch session
* Provides better sense of community
* Fewer places for nefarious people to hide and troll
* People feel less FOMA because there is only one simple place to watch

In order to still have a "community" (according to Discord) you still
need a rules channel and Discord forces a "moderators only" channel for
their notifications. Other than that, I have just have the live channel
and lobby for talk shows and podcasts (which I cover elsewhere).

Also some things to remember:

* Disable "Posting Media" which includes anything but text or links
* Get good at removing content, keep Discord up all the time
