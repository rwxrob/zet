# Nomadic living in Europe instead of America?

I just read about several adjuctions and missing persons who were camping from their cars in America. I'm sure this happens everywhere and alone it isn't enough to sway my decision to live a nomadic live. I've done it a lot. I'm not a lot wiser now than when I was in my 20s and I am also very public so reducing risk while living nomadically is more of a priority.
