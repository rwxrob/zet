# MountainCreek lessons learned

* Plan on stopping resetting at regular intervals
* Use Action 4
    * Better wide angle for forest trail shots
    * Handles tight turning better than gimble on Pocket 3
    * Less bulky and more body movement required on MTB
    * Handles light rain and foliage better
* Stay on trail closest to park
    * Consistent, worry-free modem signal
* Keep the music or not?
* Accept that phone signal will be spotty
    * Disable RTIRL stats

Next steps:
* Try Action 4 with stabilization
    * Loop with each form
* Try 1080p30 at 12,000 (restart encoder before each)
* Try no-music, no TTS, leave stickers on (but take breaks)
