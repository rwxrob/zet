# Idiot claiming PowerShell is better than bash

I about lost my shit on it when I found out he was serious. Went off saying how amazing his bloated command line was with all his `git` diff shit. Just not worth engaging assholes who come in and flex about idiotic stuff that has no basis in rational fact or statistics. Bash is the dominant shell on the dominant enterprise operating system. There are overwhelming numbers available to back that claim. Looks like I'm going to need to start putting them together to just link to instead of engaging dicks like that.

Should have banned his ass immediately and just saved myself a ton of time.
