# Fixie gear ratio 2.75 (44-16) on Ghoul

But that's nearly the same as 48-17 (2.82) on my Marrakesh on mine. People allycat race on 52 chain rings, but most are on 46-16 (2.88) so I should be perfect to start trying it out before buying a Ghoul (which only costs \$450). Once my legs are used to that ratio (and every single route I ride has been vetted to work with it) I'll go ahead and get a Ghoul and start practicing my track "skid" stops.

Gearing - 11-34T: 11-13-15-17-20-23-26-30-34
