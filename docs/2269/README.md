# Moving live into cozy community tool

`cozy` is light-weight, current project, pomo timer, community tool inspired by UNIX `.plan`/ `.project` and different coworking approaches. I've worked on `live` in the past, which focuses on live streaming, but the idea behind `cozy` is that we have a coworking platform, something for bringing community together, not just for one live-streamer. I'm starting to think `live` belongs inside `cozy`. It would be a bot that more than one live-streamer could use to coordinate their different communities while integrating with their own sub-community.
