# Leave Zwift FTP blank to get HR zones instead

FTP is fine and all at measuring the combination of aerobic and anarobic fitness, but I was saddened to learn that you can't switch it back and forth. Once an FTP number is set above zero the zones displayed are automatically based on percent of FTP (on the bike). To get the heart rate zones to show again you have to set FTP to 0 and remember so you can set it back later.
