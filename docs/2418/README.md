# Typical daily routine of this digital nomad

After several months of testing what works (for me) here's a summary of my current daily routine with the reasons I do it. (This stuff changes all the time.)

## Stay in bed but be productive

Typically my day starts by waking up and staying in bed getting as many things done as I can. Often I will wake up before the sun has even come up. I can plug in Starlink (although I usually leave it plugged in overnight), start coworking livestream, make coffee, eat nuts, and do some focused work until inevitably I have to get out of bed to address nature's call. Morning sunset is one of my favorite times of the day and biggest motivators when living a nomadic life. Somehow it makes it all worth it.

This shapes my decision about what gear to bring depending on if I'm in the car or bikepacking. For example, boiling water with an electric kettle works from the car, but generally not when tent camping while bikepacking. For that a simple isopro stove and titanium pot work better (just be careful using the stove anywhere near the highly flammable tent and sleep gear).

## Breakfast and hygiene

Once up, I eat breakfast, brush my teeth, do some yoga and pushups, find someplace to dump garbage and refill water, take a military shower (with good wet wipes), put on a natural deodorant, and change into travel mode.

## Travel during the morning

I travel for 2-10 hours a day, less on work days. The goal is to maximize good daylight hours and get to the next sustainable overnight spot that keeps with the schedule and allows plenty of time to rest and work. Along the way I stop to eat, drink, use facilities when they are available, top off my batteries, nap, and attend work meetings.

## Get to camp early

I've found that getting to my next camp destination early in the day relieves the most stress. When camping it ensures I get a spot. It also leaves room for the unexpected and mistakes in my planning. Once camp is set and I know that I have food and power to get me through the next 12 hours or so I can really relax and focus on work and rest and have fun. Otherwise, I'm constantly worried if I am going to make it or just have to bail somehow.

## Always available

As for work, I'm available 24 x 7 to anyone at work via Slack and Webex chat from my phone so I'm never blocking anyone from getting something done because of my personal schedule. I always get my hours in, but when I get them in varies depending on the day.

Given the fact that my team is spread out all over the world—in America 10am on the East coast is 7am on the Pacific—the actual hours I am doing the work just doesn't matter—and frankly never has for this type of work. This allows me to get work done at night as well. Most of my best work—even when not travelling—has been in the wee, dark hours of early morning. Working at night also makes solo adventuring much less lonely since the nights can sometimes be harsh.

Originally, I tried to schedule travel around meeting times but since meetings and time zones vary so dramatically it is better to just make my own schedule for travel and such and pause for the meeting whenever it is.

## Eat, nap, work

Once I have camp setup I eat a good meal, take a nice nap, wake up, have a bit of coffee, and work as long as my brain works. When it stops working I sleep, then wake up, coffee it up, and work some more. Some nights are more restless than others, but eventually, morning always comes.
