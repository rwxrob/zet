# Why `lynx` and not `w3m` for text Web browsing?

Both are great and I generally recommend beginners use `w3m` to get
started easily. But `lynx` provides customizations and functionality
that I prefer. The layout also makes better use of white-space when
laying out rendered Web pages. In short, `w3m` is easier and faster to
use for a beginner, but `lynx` is far more powerful and easy to read
when properly customized but is nearly useless with the default
configuration.

By the way, all the other text-based browsers are absolute, complete
shit. Stay far away from them. (If you want details ask about any one in
particular and I'll add the reasons why for that specific one. I'd
rather not even mention them to beginners.)

And no, I have no interest in seeing graphics or JavaScript in my
text-based browser.
