# DJI Action 4 in webcam mode blows away GoPro and defunct Sony cameras

Today, you only need a single camera for streaming *everything*. Yes, this includes streaming from your desktop gaming and such. The DJI Action 4 in webcam mode does absolutely anything an indoor or outdoor streamer could ever need, and it costs *less* than a Sony AS300. I cannot say enough about what great news this is.

DJI has done it. I knew they would. (I think I said so a few times.) DJI is hungry to meet the needs of content creators (unlike GoPro who caters to action sports nuts and leaves out the entire mainstream customer base). DJI's inclusion of stabilization and horizon-level lock *in USB attached webcam mode* has blown away all the competition. I've read people say they'll "never use a GoPro again in their lives." And people (like me) can finally stop complaining about Sony's deprecated line of IRL action cams being a weak-link in the IRL rig because it has not horizon-level locking, horrible attachments, requires a power-hungry encoder, is butt-ugly white, and is exorbitantly expensive because of how rare they are (having stopped making them in 2019).

Basically, DJI is listening to its customers and giving them everything we have been asking GoPro for for years.

* No power-hungry HDMI encoding needed *at all*
* Much better low-light performance
* Includes horizon-level locking
* Includes stabilization
* Powered through USB
* Water resistant (thunderstorms) if wrap USB connection well
* Allows "action" and filter lens covers including CPL
* Single USB cable is all that is needed, easily anchored, routed
* Selfie stick auto erase
* Support for existing GoPro mount products and wind noise blockers
* Built-in magnetic lock support (no screws)
* Allows optional cable-less streaming over RTMP also (at image quality cost)

Some of these things are possible on the GoPro, a few on the Sony AS300, but the Action 4 does them all.

* The Sony AS300 that I have allows water in from multiple places.
* The Sony AS300 has no *good* way to add filters and protect lense.
* The GoPro requires purchasing a media mod even to connect anything to it (so stupid).
* The GoPro overheats constantly.
* Sony and GoPro require micro-HDMI out which is *very* touchy.
