# DHC 50k Loop

This route connects some of the most scenic and bikable segments through the historic towns of Davidson, Huntersville, and Cornelius (North Carolina) and includes amazing views of farmland complete with horses, cows, goats, and antique grain silos and water towers. The route emphasizes safe roads over multi-use trails and paths to keep things relatively fast and free of pedestrians and bugs (which are extremely bad at dusk in July and August). When timed correctly, this route provides amazing views of the sunset---especially when adding a slight detour through Jetton Park---and was created with live streaming in mind (see rwxrob.tv).

One highlight of this route is the number of "watering hole" possibilities. Only one small water bottle is ever required. There are water stations on the trail coming out of River Run and Birkdale has a very posh water refilling station. Coffee shops and pubs are very common since this route travels through the heart of some of the best micro-breweries the Lake Norman area has to offer.

The route is designed to be a consistent daily ride, but can also be ridden as a loop to get in a century on the weekend (2x for metric, 3.2x for miles).
