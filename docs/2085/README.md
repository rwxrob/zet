# MDHC 100k Rolling Hills Tour

Tour of Mooresville, Davidson, Huntersville, and Cornelius along mostly trails and less-busy roads (when possible). This route deliberately takes the rolling hill option when there is one to get in climbing practice. Usually, there's a nice sight-seeing slow break between hills. Includes several refueling options including the great water-bottle spigot at Birkdale Village a little over half way.
