# Jetton Sunset Loop (50k)

This route ends with a great sunset in Jetton Park if timed correctly and connects some of the most scenic and safe segments through the bustling historic towns of Davidson, Huntersville, and Cornelius (North Carolina). It includes amazing views of farmland complete with horses, cows, goats, antique grain silos, and water towers. It also includes baseball fields and the occasional concert. The route emphasizes  safe roads over multi-use trails and paths to keep things relatively fast and free of pedestrians  and bugs (which are extremely bad at dusk in July and August). When   timed correctly, this route provides amazing views of the sunset---especially when adding the final detour through Jetton Park---and was created with live streaming in mind (see rwxrob.tv).

One highlight of this route is the number of “watering hole” possibilities. In fact, most days you won't even need a water bottle if you are okay to slow down and drink from a fountain. There are water stations on the trail coming out of River Run and Huntersville Veteran Park, and Birkdale has a very posh water refilling station. Coffee shops and pubs are very common since this route travels through the heart of some of the best micro-breweries the Lake Norman area has to offer. Bring a cooler for the car and grab a drink to take with you to the Jetton Park sunset for the perfect end to a great ride.

The route is designed to be a consistent daily ride, but can also be ridden as a loop to get in a   century on the weekend (2x for metric, 3.2x for miles).

Remember not to park at Jetton Park so you don't risk getting locked in if you miss the sunset park closure time. You can always make your way out by bike if you still want to risk it.
