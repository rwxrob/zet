# Do I Even Need a Zettelkasten Register?

After realizing how powerful the search possibilities are I'm finding it
really quite hard to justify spending any time at all on creating the
traditional register. I understand why the register had value when only
using paper; there was simply no way to search through the content. But
today `git grep` and GitHub provide very powerful search indexing that
far surpasses anything that the register would be able to provide.

I do feel over time the number of zettels will add up making an outline
of all the zettels that are roughly related a good idea. At that time
creating the register makes sense and searching will just make it easier
to make. If anything, modern technology has put off the immediate
urgency for the register because you can create one after the fact
pretty easily and do a quick search before creating a zettel to see if
you already have one on any give idea.
