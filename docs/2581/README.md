# Never coming back to this apartment

Friday, June 28, 2024, 10:30:43AM EDT

I’m outta here. Once my stuff is all in the storage unit I’m never coming back to this apartment,   ever. I’ll do my Beginner Boost live stream from the road (car or bike) and perhaps even a few      streams from my storage unit, which I will probably make up all nice. It’s become my happy place    when I’m not on the road. I have plenty of power from batteries for an evening of streaming. All I  need is to have this streaming computer sitting in the corner of wherever my step-son has his       mandatory Internet access. (That’s one thing I can absolutely count on.)
