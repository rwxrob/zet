# Twitch partner application

My stream has evolved so much in the last three years. At first I was skeptical of the entire thing, but my step-son said, "You should stream." I'm still here.

I started streaming only educational content and took it very seriously, too seriously. I hadn't learned the Twitch culture. I made some mistakes, perhaps didn't value things as I should have, and have since learned and changed so much. Hell, I'm even into emotes these days.

As another big streamer once said when I raided them with 80 people, "Everyone, this is what they call a 'variety' streamer."

I have turned rwxrob.tv into a place for personal growth, motivation, education, fun, and open, respectful dialog about the world's most controversial topics.  In fact, during one random conversation about gender I shared my personal journey having left the Mormon church over such issues and learning so much in the process (one of my son's later turned out to be gay). One of my closest community members whispered me the following:

"I am relaxing. I am intersex. I'm grateful you shared and educated about matters that have drastically affected me throughout my life. Thank you for teaching compassion and empathy in these matters. üíúüôè"

I'm no guru, in fact, I'm a very imperfect person, but I can honestly, authentically say that Twitch has made me so much better as a human being, and not just me, all those in my community. Here's a bunch of people who agree (https://github.com/rwxrob/cv/blob/main/data.yml#L507) most of whom made those comments during my many live streams.

I know I might not have the numbers of other partners, but I like to think that the numbers I do have count for so much. I love that I know the personal history of so many in my community. In fact, one of my community members that I met through Twitch literally got me my current job after Covid kills my SKILSTAK mentoring community that I had run successfully for eight years. My SKILSTAK people keep coming back, we sometimes play Overwatch together and talk about old times.

In short, Twitch is absolutely miraculous. I talk about it all the time. I can speak Russian with new friends in Russian AND Ukraine while discussing the tense situation (Russian was my major). I can speak with new French friends as well. In fact, one main motivator for applying for partner is that I see that Twitch will be in Paris in 2023 and I DEFINITELY want to go. I have all the stuff to do quality IRL bike streams (even better than Robcdee and Meikie, whom I love) and plan on doing want all around Paris when I go. I need to raise money to fund the trip even though I work 100% remotely. So being partner will help that much more. I've just changed my ad schedule to match the 55% so there's that.

I know so many people wear partner on their sleeve (literally, as would I). But I sincerely want you to know that Twitch has forever changed my life for the better and I want to help others even further. I can't count how many other new streamers I have helped with everything from motivation to setting up their own IRL rigs (just helped another in Travel & Outdoors today). I would be very honestly proud to be partner, to the point of wearing Twitch merch to my wife's Fine Art showings (which, to my knowledge, I'm the only one doing). In fact, my community was featured in a work of art (the photo in my About). I've even helped artists in the real world sell their art to my community members who wanted it (and I hope to do a lot more of that).

I truly believe I'm everything you could ever want in a partner. I am human, I have ranted, but that is a part of it. Thank you for your sincere consideration. I will make you proud you took a chance on this old dude.

Sincerely,

Rob
