# Want peace? Minimize and simplify

I've been enjoying a level of happiness and balance that I haven't had in my life in quite a while. I look forward to every day when I wake up like I once did as a kid. The feeling got me wondering what it was that I changed. I've been writing about a lot of the different reasons in different ways but they can all be summarized into two main verbs: minimize and simplify.

At first minimizing and simplifying seem like the same thing. I suppose minimizing something is a simplification. Minimizing, however, is specifically to removing anything not needed and keeping only the essentials. Simplifying attacks and removes the complexities of life that muddy it up making it hard to see through.

Here are a few ideas to minimize and simply that have occurred to me. I might put these all into a small booklet at some point.

* [Being mindful](../2107)
* [Being clean and organized](../2108)
* [Writing over streaming](../2109)
