This Summer has been a storm of events. I hope things just calm down for a while.

* Getting collections calls from medical bills for getting face smashed in
* Effectively new job now as official FTE for same work, new pay, new insurance
* Notified of family emergency in June, scrambled to find a way to travel and help
* Middle of move from Mooresville to Davidson, packing, flat tire on car, rain-storms
* Ex cuts off yet another one of our children leaving me scrambling to support them better
* Scrambled to get Starlink Gen 3 setup so can work while traveling
* Starlink Mini released literally one week after already buying Gen 3 and leaving on trip
* Travel by car back to Utah to see family, sleeping in car and working along the way
* Parents officially tell me they never want to see me again (for my being honest about childhood)
* Hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth (133) cancels planned bike tour to San Diego
* Visit to Moscow, Idaho is nice to see son, but I catch Covid-19 while there
* Moscow, Idaho back to North Carolina with raging fever and Covid symptoms sleeping in car
* Unable to work at all while sick, brain just doesn't work
* Teeth finally starting to rot and hurt from accident, I need to do something about them
* Double rent payments for three months while moving into new place
* Nearly empty bank account cancels any Summer plans to go anyplace
* Fighting severe depression (some say chronic Covid symptom)

All I am going to to is work and clean and spend time with family and ride my bike until I feel like I have some kind of control over my life again. It's been insane. I feel confident things will go back to normal over time.

The only goals I have for now are to get financially stable again (I make plenty, just need to get liquid again), catch up  with family and work, and do several long bike rides on the weekend.
