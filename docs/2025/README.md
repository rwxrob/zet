# No more notifications to anything but Discord

Just a heads up everyone, I won't be posting any announcements but those automated from MEE6 in Discord about my posting to YouTube and streaming to Twitch. This means no more Twitter and Mastodon notifications. Also going to be using Instagram more for clips and single shots. I have no idea why I didn't do this from the start, always thinking of other/better ways of doing something but then eventually run out of stream and just use the inferior alternative (in this case MEE6).
