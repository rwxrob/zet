# ðŸ’¡Emojis

Emojis are a very legitimate form of communication. They convey a lot of meaning in very little space. This makes them ideal for tagging and bringing attention to certain types of content. Rather than TODO or Figure or Video in the title or tags of a KEG content node, just add an initial emoji. In fact, the `keg create` command maps keywords to templates so that a content node of that type --- with an initial title emoji --- can be easily created.
