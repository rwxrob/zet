# 2023 New Year Resolutions

People say that resolutions are bad for you psychologically. I call bullshit. I just know that I'm probably not going to accomplish them the way that I would like, but failure is a part of it.

* [Return to daily Ashtanga Yoga practice](../1896?L)
* [Prepare for move to Greensboro](../1897?L)
* [Complete major version of enterprise REST API in Go at work](../1898?L)

Note the things that *aren't* there:

***Completing the Beginner Boost.*** While I do hope to do it, it is far more important that I complete the books listed to achieve the larger goal of getting people started out right. It is very possible I just won't have the time to dedicate five hours to hand-holding Boost video sessions in 2023. I'll be doing tons of video, and answer questions for people at the top of the hour, every hour, just not the Boost stuff. Eventually, each of those YouTube videos (with zet) will be added to a centralized outline so that the content for the Boost is actually there in modular form.
