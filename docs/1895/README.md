# 2023 New Year Resolutions and Goals

People say that resolutions are bad for you psychologically. I call bullshit. I just know that I'm probably not going to accomplish them the way that I would like, but failure is a part of it.

* [Return to daily Ashtanga Yoga practice](../1896?L)
* [Prepare for move to Greensboro](../1897?L)
* [Complete major version of enterprise REST API in Go at work](../1898?L)
* [Books to complete by end of 2023](../1901?L)
* [Go projects in 2023: `bonzai` -> `rat` -> `keg` -> `pegn`](../1902?L)
* [Personal publishing platform (`pub`)](../1903?L)
* [Twitch no-VOD, pomo-radio format and multiple categories for 2023](../1905?L)
* [Focusing on CKAD, Kubernetes applications development](../1912?L)

Note the things that *aren't* there:

* [Maybe no Beginner Boost for 2023](../1899?L)
* [Kubernetes is not a top priority in 2023](../1900?L)
* [No conference presentations in 2023, but definitely in 2024](../1904)
