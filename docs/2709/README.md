# Use `pkg/cmd` not `cmd` for Cobra commands

Everyone---except Cobra---agrees that the `cmd` directory is to contain subdirectories that have `main` packages, you know, *commands* in them. That's the whole fucking point of `cmd`. Cobra decides to ignore this best practice and do whatever the fuck even though it never had to do that. In the process is also forces the creation of unnecessary stuttering (ex: `cmd.AddCmd`) and creating a bunch of completely importable subcommand trees that cannot be combined into other monoliths with an easy import just because it was not initially designed that way.

Well, there's no fucking requirement to do it that way. In fact, one of the best command line tools ever created, the GitHub `gh` tool, decided to ignore Cobra's shitty initializer command and put everything in `pkg/cmd` instead. Thank God a big project has the courage to tell `cobra-cli` to go fuck itself and do the right thing. Unfortunately, that rebellious attitude let the GitHub team to go one step too far and create their own command `Factory` functions for dynamically generating commands in ways they they specifically want. That's fine, but why. Why not use `pkg/cmd` as Go gods intended for things like `pkg/cmd/kt/cmd.go` or `pkg/cmd/kt.go`. Using this method the directory structure can mirror that of the sub-trees as well.
