# Watching Stuff Together on https://kosmi.io/

Another [wish] I had was to be able to watch YouTube videos or anything
else at the same time without it triggering all kinds of bells with
Twitch or whatever. Apparently, <https://kosmi.io/> is the place. It
worked really well when we tested live once when someone mentioned it.
Gotta love the community finding stuff and sharing.
