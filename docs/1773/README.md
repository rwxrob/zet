# Q: Can I use GUI or should I master git terminal commands?

Absolutely, eventually everyone *must* learn the `git` command line. There are just things you really cannot even do from even the best GUI equivalents. Plus learning the command line `git` properly (from `man gittutorial`) is the bible and will remain true forever on anything. GUIs tend to come and go and change.

By the way, you really should master `gh` as well (the GitHub Command line utility).
