# Verizon confirmed to work with Netgear Nighthawk m5

I confirmed that bands B66 and B13 are being used on the m5 that I bought originally for ATT.

I just swapped the nano sim card and set the APN to one of the Verizon providers.

I was surprised that the Visible network showed up in the APN list of selections as well. I'm keeping Verizon because Visible is cheaper but "deprioritized" when there is a busy tower. I'm willing to pay 10 dollars a month more to be sure that never happens.

The LTE (4g) only network setting worked. I was *really* worried about this one. The official Verizon Inseego modems (two of which I'm still paying for) do not allow locking to 4g only. This *requires* a modem like the m5. This one fact alone is perhaps the most crucial fact an IRL streamer needs to know in America given that Verizon is the largest provider of mobile services in the country. There are so many outdoor IRL streamers who don't have a clue about this and make a bunch of really horrible suggestions (like "don't buy a nighthawk" even though it is hands down the best hotspot on the American market and works perfectly fine on Verizon if you know what you are doing).
