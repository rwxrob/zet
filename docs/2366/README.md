# DJI Action 4 Camera Review

## Pros

* *Only* action camera with webcam mode that includes stabilization and power from USB (so no battery required reducing overheating).

* Horizontal leveling in addition to stabilization so shifting back and forth on bike is okay.

* Extremely good low-light performance (even better than Sony IRL cams).

* Magnetic mounts works more more easily including mounting to anything metal.

* Clips and favorites for better vlogging clip review

## Cons

* Rear screen stopped working in first week. Camera seems relatively fragile. Get backup.

* Color balance sensor positioned between front mics making any wind-noise foam or dead-cat covering impossible.

* Digital wind-noise reduction is a joke if you want to hear anything in the environment.

* Only serious option for sound is to use DJI external microphone, but get binaural as plus.

* DJI external microphone cannot be used in "webcam" mode because there is only a single USB port *requiring* use of USB mic option with Belabox.
