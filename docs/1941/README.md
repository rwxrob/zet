# !command !cmds rwxrob.tv

ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­ Chat commands are the new "command line interface" that all humans (not just engineers) will eventually all use. You can use `!cmds` as well. Click on the link to see a full list of all supported commands.

If you see a command I'm missing (or a typo) go ahead and make a PR (if you like). Eventually, I hope to render this file as a single, relative-hyperlinked web page so people can navigate it without Twitch.
