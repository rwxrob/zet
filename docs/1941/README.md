# !command !commands !cmds !cmd rwxrob.tv

ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­ Here's a list of all commands.

Chat commands are the new "command line interface" that all humans (not just engineers) will eventually all use. You can use `!cmds` as well. Click on the link to see a full list of all supported commands. I plan on having hundreds of them and rendering them as a single HTML page as well with relative linking. In fact, there's something to be said for the hyper-linked navigation through the data. The 'bang' (!) is just a short form of linking.

If you see a command I'm missing (or a typo) go ahead and make a PR (if you like). Eventually, I hope to render this file as a single, relative-hyperlinked web page so people can navigate it without Twitch.
