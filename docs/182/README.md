* Still using Node Feature Discovery as example
* Realized we really should install private registry first
* Decided on Harbor but will to install in other video

Steps to install:

1. Identify the Helm chart
1. Create an internal git repo to contain the Helm chart
1. Download and decompress the Helm chart (tar) into repo
1. Commit the repo with a pristine version of the chart
1. Create an initial empty values.yaml (at same level)
1. Put *only* overlay changes into the new values.yaml file
1. Scan the default chart for images that must be imported internally
1. Download, vet, and install images chart requires in private registry
