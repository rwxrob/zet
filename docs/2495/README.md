# Bikepacking/DNB gear list

## Criteria

This list is ever-changing as I tweak it. Here are the main criteria for what gets on the list:

* Do I need it to live?
* Do I need it for work?
* Do I need it for livestreaming?
* Do I have everything needed to make it through GDMBR (with alt routes) leaving mid-June?

## Why so much not needed?

One thing that will seem odd to most bike tourists and packers is all the heavy winter gear I lug around even through the desert in hot months. This is because I'm more interested in creating a consistent system and rig that works for all GDMBR-like conditions no matter where they might occur. The extra weight does slow me down, but comes with the guarantee that not only can I survive anything but the most excessive, extreme weather anomalies for the locations that I bike according to my [annual schedule](../2568) but that I can work a solid, honest 40-hour week, and livestream everything but the work part. (That is where people look at me like I'm crazy. Most bike enthusiasts are looking to ignore work and tech as much as possible when they ride.)

## FAQ

## Why not use internal Orange Pi wifi module?

Not as powerful as the separate dongle, plus need a second one anyway, one for connecting to the Starlink Mini wifi (or pub or whatever) and another to provide a network access point to connect to from the phone to control the Belabox software.

## Why bring the secondary laptop?

The official work i7 16" Macbook Pro pig-of-a-laptop burns through its internal battery in four hours. I would need one or two Baseus bricks just to use it for a single day when not plugged in.

Bringing the ultra-light (3.3 lbs) Macbook Pro 14" is roughly the same weight as bringing three Baseus battery bricks, but will run for 18 hours when fully charged. Considering that I can do almost everything I need to do for work officially and legally from this personal laptop I save a tremendous amount of weight and frustration that would be wasted trying to use the official computer. Until I get a modern Macbook Pro for work I'll continue to bring the extra, and even then I probably will bring the two anyway just for the critical redundancy when and if things stop working on the official computer.

## Why the Baseus 65w battery banks?

I carry two for the Belabox and two for the Starlink Mini.

I've been using these for more than four years at this point. They have been rock-solid for me and provide just enough juice for the Starlink Mini to work (and not more). Their smaller size (compared to the popular Renology) allows them to be scaled back and to have one charging while the other is working. A single brick will power a Starlink Mini for about four hours, the typical length of a major livestream segment. The same Baseus brick will power the Orange Pi for about 20 hours and another the Netgear Nighthawk modem in "high performance mode" (which *requires* removing the internal battery) for well over 24 hours straight.

The beauty of this power system is that *everything* is using the same modular battery banks so their is built-in redundancy. In fact, I can power both the modem and the Orange Pi from the same bank in a pinch with a small USB-C adapter (and have many times).

### Why not shorter USB cables?

Inevitably I find myself needing an extra cable or connecting to something that isn't the usual thing. For example, plugging directly into the Jackery in my car while driving instead of burning up the charged battery bricks. Three feet is the minimum to make these other scenarios possible without overly cluttering the kit on my back when compacted down.

### Why not a 100w charger?

Mostly weight. The one I bought weight almost triple the weight of the 65w charger. Also, the 65w is the minimum that will work *directly* with the Starlink Mini when I don't want to burn batteries at all in camp with a hookup.
