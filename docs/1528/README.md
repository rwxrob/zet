# Most Important Tech Areas to Learn

Anyone paying a modicum of attention will tell you that the most
important enterprise tech to learn in order to catch and ride the wave
of enterprise IT for the next decade will be one of the following:

1. Machine learning
1. Operations security
1. Cloud native

No one can do all of those. You'll have to pick one. But make sure
whatever position you shoot for that it is related to one of these
things. That is, if you want to be employed by a significant
organization going into the future.

For example, I love coding, but coding stuff that help security people
deploy faster makes what I code more valuable. I also want to get
clusters to talk to each other with minimal latency, connecting GCP to
an on-prem Kubernetes cluster in effective ways. I'm still just a
"coder" in the task sense, but it's the *things* I'm coding that are in
a very high-demand space.

By the way, the Beginner Boost is lazer focused on the foundational
skills of these high-grown tech areas:

1. Linux (specifically Ubuntu and Red Hat)
1. Go Programming
1. Containers

Literally *every thing* is built using these building blocks these days.
