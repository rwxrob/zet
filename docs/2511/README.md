# Initial date paragraphs in time-based zettels

I have concluded that not having dates on a zettel can give the wrong impression when looking at them. Since so many are time-based I do think it is valuable having them. Rather than do anything crazy, I am just going to follow the convention of having a date as the first paragraph. Any parser could easily examine it to see if it is a date type and infer the type of zettel from it. And it remains very easy for anyone to read. This also allows me to set the date and time in the index when it actually matters.
