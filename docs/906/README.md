# Using Discord for Live Talk Shows and Podcasts

Discord is great for inviting other people to participate through voice
and even video on your live stream to create a talk show or podcast
format. This has particularly popularized by streamers who do dating
shows and news debates and "advice phone lines". Since Discord added
"stages" this is not drop-dead easy to setup.

* Add a channel of type "stage"
* Enable "Connect" and "Voice" for audience
* Add OBS audio source for Discord (if muting channel 2 VOD audio)

People in the live channel and lobby can still mute themselves or setup
their own push-to-talk but this way they can know that it is them and
not something forced on them by the channel.
