# ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­ coworking video disclaimer

Coworking videos are captured from live streams that are casual, messy, disorganized, full of rabbit holes, embarrassing mistakes, ranting, and the occasional swear word. If you are looking for more polished content check out skilstak.io and the SKILSTAK Beginner Boost videos (which is slightly more organized).

* Everything (including musical breaks) is streamed live <https://twitch.tv/rwxrob>.
* Good portion of coworking streams are while I'm actually working.
* Not a lot of time for questions and off-topic other than breaks.
* Watch the tomato in the upper right to see when the next break will happen.
* Breaks are usually at the top of the hour if you want to lurk and do other stuff.
* All feedback and corrections in live chat are *very* welcome.
* Anything created during the session is in <https://github.com/rwxrob/lab>.
* Often notes and discoveries are written in <https://rwxrob.github.io/zet>.
* Join the Discord <https://discord.gg/9wydZXY> for questions and feedback.
* I don't normally read YouTube video comments (although I probably should).
