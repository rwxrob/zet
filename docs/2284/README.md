# Monthly rwxrob summary video

Woke up with idea to create a summary video of all the high points from the last month into a single video every month that is highly edited (even though I've given up all hope that the YouTube algorithm would ever recover and be kind to me). Probably good to set aside one day a month to create it and put that on the calendar.
