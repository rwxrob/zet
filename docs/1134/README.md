# Flashiness is Inversely Proportional to Clue

The more cut scenes and hype and shit you encounter in the world and on
the Internet the more likely the person or persons producing it is
absolutely full of shit and making up for it with kitschy crap that
draws in people without the ability to think critically. You can always
tell these people because they will have *nothing* of value actually out
there and focus on things that draw in more viewers for no other reason
than getting more viewers. Inevitably, they will peddle their
sponsorships on you, they'll pretend to have authority, but will have no
actual experience nor solid research to draw on. You just have to get
good spotting these types of people in all areas of life and just plain
ignore them. Look harder for the people who are too busy getting work
done and producing value than make yet another cut-scene with them in a
bathroom that only people from Idiocracy would think is funny.
Unfortunately, the world is full of happy, exuberant, clueless people
just like it always has been. But you can take it upon yourself to
thwart this by producing *authentic* content about things you are
learning in that way.
