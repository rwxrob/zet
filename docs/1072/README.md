# Use Imperative Verbs for Objectives, Tasks, Skills

Use imperative verbs for objectives, requirements, tasks and skills
with only the first word capitalized and no ending punctuation, like you
would find in a job posting or during an assessment evaluation. The
imaginary preceding part of the sentence would be something like:

"You can consider yourself having passed this MUDL room when you can ..."

* Explain the UNIX philosophy
* Use the word ***grok*** in a sentence

This is the exact same convention used when writing git commit messages
and is championed by many a release engineer:

"If this commit update is applied, it will ..."

I'm not exactly sure why the trailing punctuation is left off other than
most English writing conventions simply omit trailing punctuation when
creating lists of imperative sentences or clauses. In this case each
could be used as either.
