# Add KEG for All YouTube Content

As KEG has been taking shape it has me thinking about stuff in terms of
how it would be easiest for the person following it. For example, even
though I might have a number of different playlists on YouTube about
different topics, it's more likely that someone would want to see if any
video were published and when. So putting all the descriptions and links
into a single KEG makes sense, a "YouTube KEG" so to speak.
