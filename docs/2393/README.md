# Hack super-high apartment rental prices, get max rooms

As I have been going over the costs of places to live anticipating the move coming in 2024 the costs of rent are absolutely insane right now. The best way to "hack" them is to always get the most number of rooms possible and leverage that extra room for a roommate or other usage.

One of the decisions Doris and I have had to make early is if I will even have a room in her new place---especially since she will be losing her studio as well. With a three bedroom we don't even have room for her to have a studio as it is, unless she's okay using the living room (or letting me stream from the living room).

I want to be able to go anywhere, anytime. That's my goal. But it doesn't make any sense not to pay the extra money per month to get a full room even if I'm not in it all year long.
