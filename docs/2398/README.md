# Better to stay near car when nomadic wild camping

As I pondered what type of remote life I want to pursue, the idea of "wild camping" kept popping up. All that people who do wild camping are my kinda people. Those who bounce around to different RV and camp locations are a different crowd entirely, good people, just not the kind of people I would prefer to meet compared to those who camp "in the wild".

But, in the wild means that all the stuff in the car could just be stolen at any time without anyone even noticing. Going too far away from the car in the wild is also dangerous if I fall or break something. There are ways to do that safely carrying different devices with you (assuming you are conscious to use them). But the default during most of the day is going to be living right next to the car under the Yakima awning or in the "living room" working away.

The need to venture away from the car also diminishes in the wild. There's no need to have a beautiful destination to bike *to* when I'm already there.
