# Pulling back a bit, no "Code Comments" stream

I had to cancel the Sunday afternoon stream because I want the time to do whatever I want to do. Perhaps sometimes I'll stream, perhaps not. Sometimes I'll take a nap, others I'll go for a hike. It's hard enough already having book club in the morning, but that's fine since I generally do a lot of reading in the morning on Sundays.

I still plan on regularly going Outside. I'm committed to making that a priority every day even if I can only stay outside for small amount of time and still have to ride indoors for 90 minutes.
