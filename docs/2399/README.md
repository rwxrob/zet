# Prefer to make videos instead of live stream when nomadic

TerryB stopped live streaming for all the reasons that I now fully agree with. Many of them he didn't spell out directly, but it is pretty obvious he has a certain standard for the video content that has his name on it, and a shitty, low-bitrate live stream is not something worth the money for him. He's in it for the money (action videos are his job) and there is more money to be had with well-crafted video content than with absolutely random live streams.

I still plan on live streaming, just not in the universal way that I have been (like a Robcdee or JayStreezy). In fact, you can see these IRL streamers that do it for a living seriously struggling to make ends meet and maintain that schedule of daily streaming. I plan on creating a lot more short-form outdoor IRL content for Instagram and YouTube, and one highly crafted video every two weeks as I change locations. Then I can talk about the upcoming video or the last released video in a live stream. With YouTube I can also be in the chat for the premiere.
