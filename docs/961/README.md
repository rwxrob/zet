1. Just beware

1. Colleges cannot provide bootcamps
1. Colleges cannot find the people
1. Bootcamps have morphed and are selling to colleges
1. Can be really great or "tragic"
1. Avoid anything from Trinity (under the hood)
1. Challenge-based / gamified learning has flaws
1. Do something like <https://exercism.io>
1. What happens when you don't have their platform?
1. These services don't let you figure it out

1. Always better to work to figure out a given task on your own
