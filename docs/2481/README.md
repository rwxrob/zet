# No more Jackery, using Baseus chargers instead

When I discovered that getting two additional Baseus portable laptop
chargers (four total) was going to perform *better* than the oversized, bulky
Jackery 300 Plus I decided to ditch the Jackery all together and just keep
the portal 40w solar panel it comes with. I can just hide a Baseus under
the solar panels when working remotely and cycle through the Baseus
bricks as I run out. When I'm near an outlet (which will be pretty much every day while traveling around America) I can charge all the bricks and other devices.

This works out because the laptop when it's fully charged runs for close to three hours without any supplementation. The hotspot modems I have run for at least 6-7 hours and I'll have two of them. If I watch movies on my phone instead of the laptop, which is easier in the tent anyway, then I will have no problem at all with power while away from civilization. Again, I don't plan on being away from mobile phone range (and therefore usually a power outlet) for more than 24 hours tops while in digital nomad mode. When I'm in Tour Divide mode, well, that's another thing all together but it actually works out just as well if I bring the Solar charger.

The best part of this discovery is that these fit in my ultra slim and cool San Util light panniers So I don't have to take the ugly Ortlieb beasts.
