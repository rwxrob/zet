# Use j and k for scrolling up and down in `less`

While working on the pager support in the Bonzai `help`[^1] branch I accidentally noticed that the Vim navigation of j and k work causing content being paged to scroll. Been using it for a while and never noticed that. That is reason enough for me never to look back at `more` again.
