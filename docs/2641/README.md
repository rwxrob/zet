# Is remote DNB life sustainable?

## Mini conquers connectivity

The Starlink Mini has likely put living and working from the bike very close to the realm of possibility, just not for someone who *also* likes to livestream for any significant amount of time per day (unless livestreaming is significantly limited).

In December 2023 I realized the limiter was the hotspot. They are just not reliable for real work. The Starlink G3 proved to get around that, but the 60 lbs of weight required for just one work day made it not realistic.

Now with the Mini overcoming the weight limitation the only remaining hurdle is being tethered to power sources. Carrying solar is not worth the impact. It's best to move fast in order to get to a plug outlet. The method of charging the Mini (USB battery bricks) is more portable and last longer than the heavy battery for the G3, but it is also slower to charge requiring at least four hours to get a full charge (per battery).

Assuming a six-hour workday (making up the rest on the weekend or more when recharging) that requires two Baseus 65w 30,000 mAh bricks per day just for the Starlink to maintain a good work connection. A Macbook Pro M3 16" lasts 17 hours on a single charge, just about enough for three six-hour workdays. Plus the bricks can be used to charge the Macbook as well. This seems to put **three unplugged remote work-days to be the maximum**, more than enough for those average weekend trail explorations.

## Food costs are a wash

Between eating form the super market and Taco Bell and McDonald's on resupply days food costs really are not any different than if living in an apartment.

## Cost of lodging

Unlike a bikepacking trip, DNB living requires staying places that cost a lot of money sometimes---especially during tourist season. It is easy to blow a 1000 monthly lodging budget by visiting the wrong place at the wrong time.
