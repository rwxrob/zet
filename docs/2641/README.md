# Is remote DNB life sustainable?

The Starlink Mini has likely put living and working from the bike very close to the realm of possibility, just not for someone (like me) who *also* likes to livestream for any significant amount of time per day.

In December 2023 I realized the limiter was the hotspot. They are just not reliable for real work. The Starlink G3 proved to get around that, but the 60 lbs of weight required for just one work day made it not realistic.

Now with the Mini overcoming the weight limitation the only remaining hurdle is being tethered to power sources. Carrying solar is not worth the impact to being able to move faster in order to get to a plug outlet. The method of charging the Mini (USB battery bricks) is more portable and last longer than the heavy battery for the G3, but it is also slower to charge requiring at least four hours to get a full charge (per battery).

Assuming a six-hour workday (making up the rest on the weekend or more when recharging) that requires two Baseus 65w 30,000 mAh bricks per day just for the Starlink.
