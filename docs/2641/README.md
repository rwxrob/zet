# Is remote DNB life sustainable?

I no longer think DNB living is sustainable. This is my second significant test and I didn't even really get many hours on the bike to test it. While I believe we have conquered the Internet connectivity challenge, the cost of lodging and emotional strain being away from home are just too high (for me). The appeal of DNB living remains getting outside, staying healthy, meeting new people, and seeing new things. All of this can be accomplished by simply riding the bike to one of a few different interesting locations and working there for the day, but coming home at night, or maybe camping over one night, or two. My DNB life has mostly transcended into a daily commute to wherever I feel like working that day. Then, sometimes I can drive to places within a couple of hours and work there for that week.

## Mini conquers connectivity

The Starlink Mini has likely put living and working from the bike very close to the realm of possibility, just not for someone who *also* likes to livestream for any significant amount of time per day (unless livestreaming is significantly limited).

In December 2023 I realized the limiter was the hotspot. They are just not reliable for real work. The Starlink G3 proved to get around that, but the 60 lbs of weight required for just one work day made it not realistic.

Now with the Mini overcoming the weight limitation the only remaining hurdle is being tethered to power sources. Carrying solar is not worth the impact. It's best to move fast in order to get to a plug outlet. The method of charging the Mini (USB battery bricks) is more portable and last longer than the heavy battery for the G3, but it is also slower to charge requiring at least four hours to get a full charge (per battery).

Assuming a six-hour workday (making up the rest on the weekend or more when recharging) that requires two Baseus 65w 30,000 mAh bricks per day just for the Starlink to maintain a good work connection. A Macbook Pro M3 16" lasts 17 hours on a single charge, just about enough for three six-hour workdays. Plus the bricks can be used to charge the Macbook as well. This seems to put **three unplugged remote work-days to be the maximum**, more than enough for those average weekend trail explorations.

Adding one brick per day makes livestreaming possible for four hours.

## Food costs are a wash

Between eating form the super market and Taco Bell and McDonald's on resupply days food costs really are not any different than if living in an apartment.

## Cost of lodging

Unlike a bikepacking trip, DNB living requires staying places that cost a lot of money---especially during tourist season. It is easy to blow a 1000 monthly lodging budget by visiting the wrong place at the wrong time.

## Emotional cost

Living on the road as a digital nomad (by bike or car) takes a huge emotional toll on anyone with any friends or family. This is why most YouTubers eventually give up "van life" rather unceremoniously. These people report feeling "stagnant" and disconnected, even when caravanning around with a lot of others living the same way. Being nomadic means you are always invading someone (or something) else's turf, you are the foreigner. That's the point. You are wandering and exploring, but you don't have a party or tribe to do it with you.

By nature, humans are not solo, nomadic creatures. We are pack animals, like dogs, highly communal. We cannot survive emotionally and physically without a tribe. The most famous nomadic peoples (Tibetans and Native Americans) always had their extended families with them. After two weeks all I wanted to do was reconnect with my children and family. The spectacular vistas and interesting lands lost all appeal compared to being with those I love. It's not "home sickness" it is just our nature. While soldiers and some professions require humans to be away from those they love, its always the promise of a return that makes it special. Willingly leaving those people for an extended amount of time very quickly loses all appeal, for anyone.
