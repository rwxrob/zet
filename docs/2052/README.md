# Shimano SPDs for the urban and touring cycling win

Having been some decades since I followed the cycling scene seriously at all, I was super pleased to see that Shimano SPDs are still the preferred cycling clipless pedals. I had some of the first ones ever released in the 90s both on my road and mountain bikes back then, and that is the number one reason to put SPDs on all my bikes now --- especially my Marrakesh adventure/gravel/touring machine. Knowing I have the most universal clipless pedals system the world has ever seen on my bike that will see as much of the world as I can possibly manage makes me more warm and fuzzy because chances are I can find a replacement anywhere in the world if and when these were to break (but let's be honest, they just never break).

SPDs also seem to have the broadest support among companies that produce fashionable footwear that is SPD enabled because they are so minimal. My new [DZR H2Os](https://dzrshoes.com/products/h2o) aren't just the coolest bike shoes I've ever owned, they are possibly the coolest shoes I've *ever* owned, period. They're leather makes them look so damn nice. They have a skater look, in fact, I'm quite sure I'd be able to skate with them in a pinch. They are 100% waterproof so rain and show be damned. They have ankle support and can be worn with or without socks equally well. These are just so damn cool. In fact, I find myself planning urban excursions on my single-speed or gravel bike just to be able to wear these specific shoes, and any show that makes me want to bike more is definitely worth that extra few dollars. For the price of one clickity-clack pro clipless pair of shoes I can buy four pairs of DZRs. But I feel at home wearing DZRs *both* to Critical Mass events and art openings. Nothing says more about a person than their shoe choice, and I *love* everything these say about those who wear them, and that I can immediately identify a member of the urban cycling tribe no matter what the event is ... or recruit new members.

"Where's you get those shoes? I love them."

"Oh you do?"

"Yeah, are they leather skater shoes?"

"Yes and know. They're urban cycling shoes."

"The leather looks so amazing, what did they treat it with? Are they waterproof?"

"Yep. Perfect for walking city streets between bike rides."

"Damn! I love them. I might have to take up commuting so I can justify buying some."

"Hell yeah! And when you do, come the Critical Mass event with us on 4th Fridays."

"Definitely!"

What am I giving up? They are not as cool as the Time ATAC that all the fixie-obsessed bike messengers used (who require then to keep clipped in more reliably when they don't have a break, which is just fucking stupid). But honestly, I don't care about that. I have a brain that works and want to keep it that way, so I ride single-speed (with a freewheel and break) in urban environments and don't need to do any of the crazy tricks that a bike messenger would. The SPDs are just fine for the occasional bunny hop I might be forced to do. Besides, in my outdoor streaming world I would be doing many bunny hops anyway because I'll have my streaming camera rig on my back usually. In other words, I have to be a smarter cyclist instead of depending on my harder-to-randomly-clip-out clipless pedals making up for my stupidity, like choosing to ride a bike that requires a forced skid to stop instead of a fucking break. Nothing says "I'm a moron with a death wish" more than riding a fixie. At least it makes it easy who to avoid riding with (which these morons also prefer).
