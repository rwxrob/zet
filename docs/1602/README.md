# I Hate Mechanical Keyboards

Use a mechanical keyboard near my cubicle and I'll kill you with it.
That is all.

By the way, I use the same keyboard used by the world's greatest
novelists, journalist, screen-writers, and pretty much ever other writer
(not to mention more than half the developer population). I'll let you
guess what it is.

Gamers are negatively impacting the health of everyone by pushing their
'blues' on the world when they could very well be giving everyone using
them carpal tunnel (like back in the 90s when all we had were mechanical
keyboards).
