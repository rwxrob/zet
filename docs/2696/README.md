I think rather than continue to make shell scripts or even independent Go CLI commands that I need to create a standard for composable Cobra commands and create a tool for initializing Cobra compatible stuff. I'd name my command `cobra-cli` just because the official one is, um, not good.

I could keep the legacy behavior, or not. It's really horrible. I mean, how short-sighted can you be to not see the benefit of subdirectories to contain nested subcommand trees?
