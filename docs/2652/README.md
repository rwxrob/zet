New work computer arrived: Macbook M3 Pro, Nov 2023. It's fast, real fast. Some people will bitch about it being a Mac but I'm too old to care at this point. This is the best computer I've ever owned in terms of productivity, battery life, and aesthetics. Who cares if Apple is evil, what company isn't these days.
