# Starlink enables hassle-free wild camping

Starlink works *anywhere* that isn't covered. This means I can take full advantage of all the free BLM land camping locations anywhere in America. And, at this point, I want to visit every single one of them. Wild camping is so much easier and hassle-free than attempting to camp in another area.
