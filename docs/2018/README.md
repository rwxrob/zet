# Using DankChat over IRL Chat

Everyone is gaga over IRL Chat (the app) but it is still missing some major things:

* DankChat includes video preview in the main stream with a single tap.
* DankChat allows names to be omitted from TTS.
* DankChat displays number of people in chat.
* DankChat let's you filter out keywords and users.

That's enough to keep me from using IRL Chat. Every time I get convinced to try it I run into those problems.
