Been enjoying the time away from streaming, it's given me a chance to rethink what I actually want to do with these last few (hopefully) decades, what do I want my days to be filled with. It's helped that Doris and I have been spending several hours with each other every day. It's been glorious. This has been the first week of my return to a daily Ashtanga yoga practice. I've just been doing a very modified half-primary series (through Navasana) but still. Just the sun salutations have been enough to wake up a whole bunch of muscles I forgot I had. They've been complaining all week and are finally starting to stop. I remember from triathlon strength training (Joel Friel) reading about "anatomical adaptation" when everything gets dialed in to be able to do the *actual* training. I feel like I'm coming off of that. The Triathlete s Training Bible has AA for 6-8 weeks I think. But since I'm not planning any really heavy weight lifting at this time I suppose I can just stay in AA for a while, at least until the daily soreness goes away. To be honest, I missed the whole-body feeling of soreness. I came to associate that feeling itself with health, which reminds me, I need to actually read Exercised, a book about the culture of exercise and how some join and others never do and the contrast between the two global communities, those who exercise and those who don't.

As for the bike stuff, I'm sure the people who like watching IRL POV bike streams are a little curious what is happening. The short answer is they got postponed while I wait for all the stuff to convert my Keshy into an all-season gravel adventure cycling bike. All that stuff is here now and I just rented a storage unit in walking distance so I can do all the bike work streams from there.

They did jack the Starlink Roam cost up 16 dollars and added in-motion (which was already possible without them adding it). So I dropped the Mini to the 50/month minimal plan and added another Verizon modem (two total) since most of my daily bike streams will be in populated areas with good mobile coverage. My Goblin route is very well known to mostly all be supported. The weekly trip to Charlotte on the greenways does have several unstreamable spots that require the Starlink and I can just use it then. The Starlink will stop after it maxes out the bandwidth (unlike ATT which begins charging overages).
