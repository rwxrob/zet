# Just hearing about Nostr (I hate that name)

Immediately I'm put off by the idiotic name. Then I learned it is from Jack Dorsey and had to force myself to read further. (Anyone who thinks bitcoin is a good idea and who convinced VC to fund something as fucking brain-dead as Twitter immediately falls under the "sus" category for me.)

But the idea of decentralized social media is something I like, obviously (I would not have imagined KEG without agreeing).

The biggest obvious flaw, as usual, is assuming that everyone participating has a computer. 40% of the world still makes less than 2 dollars a day and has no Internet access. How are *they* going to participate? They cannot have a flash drive to offline their communications and bring it to the village library or computer hub. They are---once again---left out of consideration by the billionaire assholes with "great ideas" like micro-blogging your bowel movements.

I'm not interested. Get back with me when you have something that considers *all* the world's population.
