# How are you doing animated terminal background?

* I full screen a **Gnome-Terminal** (but any terminal will work) and
  set the transparency. For me I just type F11 and it goes into full
  screen.

* I find a good **background video on YouTube** that is okay with
  copyright and loop that in full screen as well.

* I find a good **sound effect or music YouTube video**, again with no
  copyright restrictions, and loop that as well.

It is a little hard to manage them. But I have gotten used to managing
everything with Alt-Tab (Command-Tab for me) so I can switch between
them fast enough when needed.

I have been really loving PopOS `Super` key window zooming so I can get
a quick look at everything in real-time even while still displaying.
This is particularly important when streaming with hotkeys for important
things like hiding your screen to do scary stuff. You can tap `Super`
just to glance at OBS to make sure the preview is what you expect before
doxing yourself.
