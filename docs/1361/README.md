# Use `prev` and `next`, not `left` and `right`

When creating tree data structures in any language using `left` and
`right` assumes the only people reading and using your code speak
languages that go from left to right. There are actually several great
languages that do not. Using the words `previous` and `next` apply in
all languages and will be cleaner to read for everyone.
