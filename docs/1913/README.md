Never been happier with Twitch than pretending to be a radio station that focuses on HackerBeachYoga music and vibe. I'm really leaning into this in 2023. Here's the regular stuff that I'm really going to try extremely hard to keep going with in 2023:

* 10-hour streams minimum, as long as I'm awake, I'm streaming
* 10-minute breaks at the top of pretty much every hour
* Daily Yoga at 3:30pm - fat guy does Ashtanga
* Daily Sunrise (7:30am) and Sunset (5pm) - just music and great views, light talk
* Satan Saturdays (DevilsPlaylist) - change it up a bit, code/hack/crank

I realize this is like 3-4 hours of my day, every day, but what the fuck am I living for if I can't at least do that?

I am *not* putting anything else officially on the schedule. That should cover everything, that and the daily/hourly breaks to answer questions.
