Never been happier with Twitch than pretending to be a radio station that focuses on
HackerSkateYogaVibe. I'm really leaning into this in 2023. Here's the regular stuff that I'm really going to try extremely hard to keep going with in 2023:

* 10-hour streams minimum, as long as I'm awake, I'm streaming
* 2-5 minute breaks at the top of the hour
* Daily Yoga at 3:30pm - fat guy does Ashtanga
* Daily Sunset/IRL at 5:30 (after Yoga) - meet, music, manger (Bhakti yoga)
* Yoga talk Saturdays at 3:30pm - support those getting started, answer questions, music
* 🐧 Homelab init - Saturdays working on the homelab (to keep it hacker-ey)

I realize this is like 3-4 hours of my day, every day, but what the fuck am I living for if I can't at least do that?
