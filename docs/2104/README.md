# Assault on Mt. Mitchel personal training plan

I will complete **The Assault on Mt. Mitchel** in under six hours before I turn 60 (even through plenty have after 60). Based on previous results that would put me in the top three for my age group (55-60). I'm planning my first attempt in 2024 and will likely use Keshy, my 27 lbs beast. (For 2025 I'll shoot to buy a climbing bike, Specialized Aethos Comp, if, and only if, I hit all my other weight and fitness goals first.)

I'm not really interested in any other events at my age. I have Zwift for (safe) race competition if I want it. I just want one well-managed Gran Fondo per year to keep me motivated.

Being a full-time employed 55-year-old, my schedule has a lot more recovery and fun than would a pro but I still enjoy the *feel* of pro training and fitness. It's been fun being recently reminded what pro-level fitness feels like. I'm getting hints of it already. It's absolute bliss and very addicting.

## Short-term goals

By end of May 2023:

* Daily 20-minute WFW (wake-fast-workouts)
* Weekly training: 1 day power, 2 long base days, 1 fondo day, 3 days recovery
* Drop from 85 to 80 kilos.
* Earn 60% of Zwift Tron bike.

## Long-term goals

* Get the Zwift Tron bike.
* Get to and maintain 60 kilos (at 174cm that's Mick Jagger skinny, climbing specialist).
* Reach and maintain 300 FTP (5.00w/kg).
* Regularly place top 1% of Zwift Cat Bs for my age group.
* Bike from Charlotte to Asheville in one day, rest one day, back one day.
* Do **Zwift - Four Horsemen** (or equiv) every weekend but recovery weeks.
* Do **Assault on Mt MitchellÂ®** every year (165k/3420m <https://www.strava.com/segments/634337>).
* Save money to get a <9 kilo aero+climbing bike like Specialized Aethos (Marrakesh is 13.27 kilos).

## Training hours per week

I have a lot less demands on my time as I age. My kids are grown, my wife is doing her own thing, and my job is solid and remote (no commute time).

To maintain that pro feel I have to do more than the minimum to stay in shape. The average sedentary person probably only needs 30 minutes a day to *maintain* good fitness (once they have reduced their weight and adapted). I want more than that (after I've reduced my own weight and adapted).

I figure I'm going to need 1-2 hours a day on weekdays and Saturday and 4-6 hours on Sunday to achieve these goals. That's about 20 hours a week. I would train 25-30 a week back in the triathlon days (but I have zero interest in triathlon at this point, just looks silly to me now).

## Sleep hours per week

I sleep more than most people, but for a specific reason.

* 10 hours a day minimum.
* 9 at night with 1-2 hour nap after training.
* Not necessarily all at the same time.

Pro cyclists sleep a minimum of nine hours a day, which means they are either cycling, eating, or sleeping for most of their existence, and *they are in their 20s*.

The single biggest limiter for an older person is dramatic drop in ability to recover from training. So if a pro needs nine hours of sleep, a 55-year-old is going to need 12-15 hours for the same load. Reducing the load by 1/3 and you land at around 10 hours a day of sleep to maintain a semi-pro, masters 55+ age-group status.

I've found that I *require* 1-2 hours of sleep within an hour of any daily workout if I want to recover at all. That's what being 55 means. Therefore, to be an older weekend-warrior I *must* sacrifice time doing other things in order to sleep enough (see **Don'ts**).

Sleep is my new hobby. Sleep after training is *glorious*! I almost look forward to it as much as the training. I have such vivid dreams, and just the feel of a cushy, cozy bed after a good recovery meal, nice warm shower, and that wonderful post-training pain and feeling of accomplishment is better and more addicting than anything I can do in front of a computer---especially getting drunk.

## Total hours per week

There are 160 hours in a week.

* 70 sleep
* 20 training
* 40 work
* 30 remaining

Obviously, if I had a two hour car commute (like some have) I couldn't do this.

## Periodization

I've noticed that my recovery cycles don't always match up with a given week. Joel Friel calls this out as well in his latest Triathlon Training Bible. The solution seems to be not focusing on the specific day, but the rotation of types of training no matter what day they may occur and even if the cycle is ten days instead of seven. When it works out to be a week rotation here's what it looks like. 

1. RECOVER: nap, reduce calorie dense foods
1. POWER: off-bike strength training + FTP/Hill Intervals
1. BASE: 1 hour Z2 with Z4 refreshers every 10 minutes
1. BASE: 2 hours Z2 with Z4 refreshers every 10 minutes
1. RECOVER: nap, reduce calorie dense foods
1. BASE: 1 hour zone 2 with small sprints at end, fuel for fondo next day
1. FONDO: 2-4 hours fondo pace, nutrition training

I've been doing a 20mWFW every single day as well but not sure that counts as training. Usually, I do pullups, pushups, and ab-bikes to failure plus a short Zwift ride with rest of time.

Sometimes I have to throw in a recovery day after power workouts, or after the first base. Depending on how long or hard I pushed on the fondo day I might have to take two recovery days instead of one.

## Diet

After a lot of research about what the pros eat and watching I've arrived at a pretty good diet for myself. Plus my body has adapted to a better diet and certain foods don't even appeal to me anymore.

The single worst thing anyone can do trying to lose weight is stop eating while training. It stops the ability to produce more intense training that burns more calories than just not eating.

The single best thing anyone can do to lose weight is *not* overeat on the recovery and off days. Make sure protein is covered, then veggies, then the carbs and fats minimally.

### Only social alcohol

I absolutely hate alcoholic drinks now, which is so strange since I once loved them. I had some red wine the other day and the inflammation and lack of recovery it caused the next day made me physically loathe the idea of drinking more, same with beer.

If I am at a party, however (and they are not frequent), I will imbibe.

I have absolutely no judgment for people who love to drink, seriously. I get it. I just choose not to drink any longer.

### Limited dairy

I add a bit of cheese for flavor and do eat yogurt with stuff in it, but that's it. If I ever do indulge in pizza I'll only take a single slice and really eat it slowly.

### No meat but eggs

After the **Eating Ourselves to Extinction** documentary I have no desire to eat meat. I've been having two eggs and some toast for breakfast and it has been wonderful. (Yes, I know eggs are meat, but they are the most sustainable.)

### No fried anything

Frying food destroys it.

### Easier on the chips

Corn chips have been a big part of my diet over the years, but the salt and fiber causes water retention which is bad for performance since you get heavier but cannot access the water locked up in the fiber. Plus the salt quickly dehydrates.

### Small, regular sips of water

Getting dehydrated (which I chronically was before) is the single worst thing that can happen to nutrition since all those nutrients you consume have no way of getting to the cells where they are needed. Without water your entire digestive system grinds to a halt causing all kinds of problems.

### A lot more rice

Simple white rice is a cheap replacement for all those bars and gels and stuff. You can put anything into it and turn rice cakes into whatever you need in terms of carb balancing.

### Lots of salsa and veggies

Burrito bowls are my favorite. I make my own for one dollar at home instead of paying 10 dollars at a restaurant.

### Bananas

Bananas are the magical cyclist food. Let them ripen and you get more simple sugar, less ripe and you get simple, but slightly complex carbs as starches. You can dial in the type of (ultimately) glucose that you need simply by letting them ripen.

### Homemade muesli

When you combine everything yourself you can decide the carb balances. Then I either heat it up for breakfast, combine it with yogurt for a snack, or put it in some almond milk in the fridge to heat up.

### Recovery drink after hard session

I do purchase an electrolyte and protein recovery drink. I also have zero-sugar electrolytes that I drink during sessions.

## Don'ts

I've had enough time now to realize many of the extremely bad habits I had locked into my life before. I really don't want to fall into them again.

* Don't get mad, get busy (which I can't do if I'm sick or dead).
* Don't worry, be happy.
* Don't stress out over everything wrong in the world.
* Don't even look at social media unless it is stuff that makes me happy.
* Don't play video games.
* Don't live-stream unless it is meaningful.
* Don't worry about others, focus on myself.
* Don't dwell on the past.
* Don't drink alcohol except for very occasionally.
* Don't pay for things because I am too lazy (overpriced food, etc.)
* Don't let laundry and cleaning go for more than a week.
* Don't retaliate even if justified.
* Don't starve yourself by becoming too obsessed.
* Don't lose track of time.
* Don't forget to spend time reading and learning.

I'm sure this list will grow as I remember things.

Anything that produces stress produces bad-fat-making cortisol *destroys* fitness gains and doubles the time to recover from fitness. It's no surprise the stuff I'm cutting *all* produces stress.
