# Another reason to learn vi/vim: k9s key bindings

If you are a fan of `k9s` (and if you are a Kubernetes administrator these days you probably shoudl be) then you know that this little terminal gem of an application support vi-style bindings right out of the box. That's right, no need to configure it, no need for `set -o vi` equivalent. It just works, further proof that Vi is king when it comes to terminal editors and interfaces where infrastructure engineers and operations people are concerned.
