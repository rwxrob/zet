# Scent-Away wet wipes best for DNB?

I've been stuggling with what kind of wet wipe to use. I love the Eucalypteus and Tea-Tree oil version but a bear (or human) can smell that a mile away. Then I discovered Scent-Away wet wipes that hunters have been using forever to remove their scent, offensive and bear-attractive. The great thing is that these are available at any Walmart in America (which is all over the place). They are better than just plain baby-wipes and also help hide you from a bear even more.
