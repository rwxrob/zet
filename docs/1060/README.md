# What are you using to chat in terminal?

An ancient (but superior) technology called IRC (Internet Relay Chat).
Fortunately, Twitch supports it. Unfortunately, Twitch doesn't support
*all* of it. See the Twitch Without the Twitch videos for how to use it.

I also use Weechat in my terminal, which provides a nice FIFO for
communicating with IRC directly from any application running on the
system simply with redirection of stdout. (But it's not quite quick
enough to read from without lag.)
