# Chat rules

* Please help me stay positive during all streams that aren't specifically about politics or religion.
* Honest to God, I'm trying to be less of a ranty, angry old dude (even though some sub for that).
* Let's keep politics and religion to specific streams designed to contain these conversations as much as possible.
* If you violently disagree with me that's fine, please help people understand my position, however, in my forum.
* Don't call me out for stuff if you only drop by once a week and don't even know me (unless you want an instaban).
