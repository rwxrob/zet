# Dreamed Twitch Separated Software from Game Dev

My subconscious is apparently corrupted with thoughts about Twitch.
Given the number of hours I'm here, this seems at least not unusual. I
had a very vivid dream where I was randomly informed by a community
member that there was now a dedicated programming category that didn't
have Game Development, that the game developers lobbied to have their
own category because they were being unfairly grouped with other
programmers. I was giddy with joy. It was such a weird dream.
