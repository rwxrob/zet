# Still conflicted about remapping CapsLock to ESC

I have had `CapsLock` mapped to `Esc` for a while now (which is totally justified because that is where the `Esc` key *originally* was). But my fingers are so completely used to using `Control-[` that changing is going to be a bitch. I keep this (irrational) fear that I will be caught on a system where the key has not been remapped, oh I don't know, like on my work Windows laptop, which is actually the case. In fact, I just made myself un-conflicted about this whole thing. Remapping anything is a bad idea unless you can do it on *every fucking computer you use* because I regularly TMUX in from whatever computer is available and if I had memorized `CapsLock` instead I would be rather fucked.

(And I still cannot believe that otherwise rational and efficient Vim users out there actually recommend using `Control-C` instead of `Esc`. I think that is the fucking stupidest advice regarding Vim I have ever heard.)
