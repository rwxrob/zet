# Being mindful

> Mindfulness means maintaining a moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment, through a gentle, nurturing lens.

Mindfulness is more than focus. In includes acceptance and observation. At the core, mindfulness is about being aware of what I am doing and focused on it without distraction. The Pomodoro technique is a way of manufacturing mindfulness in 25-minute segments. For some that works. The principle is the same no matter how you accomplish this.

What doesn't work, however, is attempting to be mindful while in an environment that demands constant distractions. Being mindful requires blocking out distractions, even good ones, such as these:

* Being up when everyone else is asleep just to be at peace outside and think
* Wearing headphones and locking the door between me and my family while writing
* Putting in earplugs to block the deafening wind noise on a long training rides
* Disabling chat notifications in Slack while at work
* Reducing live-streaming to times when I can respond and interacting

I am more mindful now that ever and it shows. I feel like my psyche is so much cleaner.
