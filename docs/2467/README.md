# Can only post Instagram Reel from app

Just learned that if you create an Instagram reel using something like DaVinci Studio that I have to open up Instagram and click on "Share to Facebook" to get it to do the same thing that creating the Reel on Instagram in the app would have done before. In other words, posting to Instagram on the Web does not do the same thing as from the app.
