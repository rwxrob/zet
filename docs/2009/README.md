# Get to 150 lbs by mid-June

I'm 205 right now, heaviest I've ever been. I got a *lot* done during the time I put on all that weight, but alas, it's not worth it if I have to lose so much time trying to get my health back. I'll well on my way to getting there, but this means absolutely *nothing* gets in the way of my diet and exercise over the next 18 weeks.

* 3500 calories to lose 1 lbs of fat
* 3 lbs of fat loss per week (more is unsafe)
* 10500 calories per week
* 1500 calories per day
* About 2 hours a day cycling or yoga
* No alcohol

If I keep up with this, I'll be at 150 by June 14, Flag Day just before Father's Day.
