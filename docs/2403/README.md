# No doxing next home location and address

Doris and I have agreed that we do not want to ever stream or disclose our next home location. We just don't want the hassle of having to think about it. We'll have an opportunity to go back to living a private life in person. And given the fact that we will be upping the activities outdoors and such, and that I will be hopefully increasing in the number of people who find the YouTube outdoor content, it makes sense to dox as little as possible.
