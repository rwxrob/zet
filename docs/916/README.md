# Surprise, Docker Desktop is Proprietary (Not FOSS)

Docker really surprised me when they announced 'enterprise users' where
now going to have to pay \$5/month. Not because of the cost, but because
I *thought* Docker Desktop was FOSS. Nope.

There are many amazing people at Docker, some I have met, but I'm done
with Docker as a company after this. It was a completely reasonable
thing to do, from a corporate perspective, but I had no idea I was using
proprietary software --- and more importantly would be illegally using
it for my contract work for my employer unless something changed and I
brought it up with them. It was probably my fault for not checking more,
but it doesn't change my personal decision. Others may decide
differently and in this case the world won't be affected either way.
Docker Desktop is a relatively good software package, (despite it
breaking that one day with an update that took me down, unable to work,
for more than four days.)

I've decided to use and promote `minikube` instead of Docker Desktop,
which is actually *way* better. I didn't always think that. It took
Docker's 'you have to pay now' and Google's privacy violations to
recommend some reading on the topic to get me to discover the true value
of `minikube`.

Bottom line: I would rather support *any* FOSS offering over a
proprietary one.
