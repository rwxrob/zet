# Kubernetes Applications (K8SAPP) Management Conventions

There are many ways to install and manage Kubernetes applications:

* `kubectl` Scripts
* Kustomize
* Helm
* Modified Helm
* Operator Framework
* Custom Operators
* Adapted Terraform and/or Ansible

Cloud native administrators are forced to learn one or all of these
since there is no agreement in the industry as to any standard.
Moreover, the industry is full of overly-hyped frameworks and "package
managers" vying for dominance while failing to meet even minimal
requirements for air-gapped security and sustainability. This situation,
brought about by attempting to force imperative IT business processes
into declarative "solutions," has created chaos and a climate of
conflict and shame for those refusing to use the Kubernetes application
management "standards" when, in fact, the safest and most sustainable
approach is to keep things simple: just use Kubernetes resource files
and `kubectl` and follow a conventional methodology.

Amidst the chaos, a common set of admin practices seems mandatory so
that each application is looked after in a way that is implementation
agnostic (like you would do with an interface when programming). One
does not care *how* these practices are fulfilled, only that they are.
Some can be scripted, some are a matter of documentation, but all are
required for any application to makes it into your production cluster.
One could say that every application can implement its own *methods* for
the same *operations*. Operations are the actions taken by any cloud
native admin, or by a script on behalf of the admin. 

To be clear, this is not yet-another-abstraction (even though it can be
implemented as such). It's just a matter of agreeing on what everyone on
the admin team should do with respect to *all* Kubernetes applications
while allowing each its own specificity.

The K8SAPP contract simply asks that all team members agree to the
following:

* Maintain manifest of all installed applications in own repo (ex: `k8sapps`)
* Provide a Git repo for each application (allows GitOps, etc.)
* Tag each version using semver versioning (ex: `v0.1.1`)
* Use a consistent prefix (ex: `k8sapp-`)
* Provide a detailed README.md with description, etc.
* Provide a metadata file (ex: `k8sapp.yaml`)
* Provide single resources file named for namespace (ex: `nfd.yaml`)
* Keep a vendored copy of the original application (ex:
  `helm/some-chart-0.8.tgz`, `helm/index.yaml`)
* Document the following procedures (as `##` in README.md):
    * Fetch - acquire from external authoritative source
    * Review - flatten, read README, Helm charts, policies, deps, etc.
    * Configure - adapt original to match environment (`values.yaml`)
    * Install - install the application for the first time
    * Upgrade - install an upgraded version of the application
    * Uninstall - remove all traces of the application from the cluster
    * Check - latest version, dependencies, is there an update?
* Add a *## Related* section with related reading
* Keep a manifest of all installed apps in own Git repo (ex: `k8sapps`)

Vendoring is the process of saving external dependencies with one's own
code. K8SAPP leverages the vendoring approach to preserve Helm charts and
other YAML resource files that originate outside of the project.
Acquiring these external resources can be included in a `fetch` action
or simply documented in the README.md when an Internet connection cannot
be assumed.
