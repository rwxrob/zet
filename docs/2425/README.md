# 4k YouTube videos take a long time to publish

Well duh. Here are some time estimated based on experience (mine and others):

Time | Process
-|-
15 frames / second | Rendering from DaVinci Resolve
4 min / 1 minute | YouTube processing
31 mbps | My current upload speed

For a video of my "three hour tour" bike ride (which was actually closer to 2.5 hours) it took three hours to render, three hours to upload, and four hours to process. It also burned 40 GB of bandwidth for that upload.

The upside is that I didn't have to spend any time at all editing things, just running it through the YouTube project template to get it rendered. In fact, I could still use the computer doing the rendering to do other things (within reason).
