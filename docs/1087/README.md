# 2000% Increase in Golang Malware

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/aEDDTHj70II>

Made a video on YouTube about the recently reported increase in malware. I've been predicting since about 2015 that Go's unique compiled artifact footprint, relatively changing compilation techniques, combined with being statically linked, cross-platform compilable, C compatible, and drop-dead "simpler C syntax" would have malware coders to pleased they would eventually make it their favorite for all malware, well it seems that is what has happened. It's hit mainstream press now because major malware and ransomware is popping up all over now in Go. So if you want to attack or understand attackers, Go is your darling (and always probably should have been). I will laugh out loud when the Metasploit database has to figure out how to take in all the new Go code that's popping up. The CVE people only add a new category for the language in 2019 (or something). The hackers are fucking loving this.
