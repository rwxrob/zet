# !category !cat rwxrob.tv

ðŸ˜‰ Why so tribal? People get *really* upset if you don't stream in the category they think is better than others. Gilfoyle would stream to *Science and Tech*. Dinesh would stream to *Software and Game Development*. Erlich would stream to *Just Chatting* (where I stream most content these days). People ban me from tech streamer lists because I talk too much, so must be right cat for me.
