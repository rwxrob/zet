# Streaming studio morphs into virtual gym

Some people call it a "pain cave" but I hate that term. Sure it hurts on occasion to push yourself while exercising or climbing a mountain, but it is a very pleasurable pain, the kind that immediately has you wanting more once complete. So what should I call it? I like "virtual gym" because that is what it is.

I've successfully redone my entire streaming studio room to become my virtual gym. 

* Went though entire closet and all boxes with gear and stacked.
* Reorganized IKEA standing desk into standing-only mode.
* Positioned Zwift bike so can type on keyboard from bike.
* Put all speakers and fans under desk.
* Bought and configured a twin bed in the corner for laptop work.
* Stored all my 20" monitors and replace with a 60" and 40" television.
* Placed 60" television full width of standing desk.
* Attached 40" on top of IKEA storage near ceiling for monitoring.
* Run Zwift on 60" and movie or monitoring on 40".

If the family would let me I'd even put the treadmill in here. But I've decided running will *always* be outside no matter the weather. Running is something you can do in *any* weather condition. I really miss it, but last time I ran outside, I realized I'm just to old, heavy, and untrained to put that kind of stress on my body, particularly my legs. One 10k hilly run knocked me out for almost of week of recovery before I could do anything. In contrast, three 2 hour sessions on the bike and I can do the same the next way with regular recovery.

I do have one problem, a good problem. I want to Zwift more than I want to stream. Everything is setup for me to just sit and spin. It's so easy and inviting. To stream, I have to move everything and reconfigure, which is annoying. Since I'm Zwifting topless these days to control the heat (which makes a *huge* differnce) I just don't feel like streaming it. Plus I can put a movie on and watch that while climbing the Alpes du Zwift. It makes the time fly by, and now that I have a better seat, I can go for two hours no problem, about the time for a full movie. Yesterday I did six-ish hours in three 1-2 hour sessions, and I'm not even sore now.

I do want to stream, for sure. But the annoyance of reconfiguring my virtual gym back into a place where I can stream is going to make my streams much more specific. I only want to  stream if there is a *reason* to stream, and anything I can do while walking around or cycling outside IRL will take precendence over streaming from any seated position. I haven't figured it out yet, but rwxrob.tv will definitely be different from now on.
