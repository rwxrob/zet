# SKILSTAK Beginner Boost Moved to Saturdays

Originally, I thought that because Saturdays are the best day of the week to do IRL Travel and Outdoor streaming that the Boosts would be best on Sundays (when people and shop are generally closed and doing their own thing). But it turns out, that Sundays are very bad for the international community since it borders into their early Monday morning hours. So I moved it back to Saturdays. Given the percentage of internationals who are great members of this community it is the least I can do.
