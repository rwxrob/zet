# Why do you wrap at 72 columns?

Because this has long been the standard width for code and I like it. It
ensures everything is readable on the most screens.

I used to like to allow paragraphs to do their own wrapping, but that
was back with I was doing a lot of [TMUX pane splitting][1], which I now
find annoying and unnecessary.
