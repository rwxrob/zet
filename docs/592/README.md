# Keep a Solutions Mindset

Always be thinking, "What problem am I solving here?" Don't worry about
*how* to solve the problem, yet. As engineers it is easy to get pulled
into the details of specific solution implementation before we really
have outlined the problem to be solved. I don't know how many times I
was told as a junior "that's an implementation detail" while learning
this lesson. If you care already constructing functions and APIs in your
head in your favorite language while just talking about what the
customer (maybe your boss) needs then you are falling victim to this
type of thinking.

I once had a random beer and the Old Town with a senior executive IT
consultant who seemed to be being paid obscene amounts of money to help
fortune 10 companies transform their IT organizations. He was a little
drunk and after exchanging stories for a while he put his hand on my
shoulder and said, "Make sure you teach them to focus on solutions."
