# Q: What do you recommend for helping write code comments?

* Start with the simplest code comments possible
* Maybe turn your TODOs into comments
* Don't write stupid comments that restate the obvious
* Have a native English speaker review or write the main comments
* If you are already doing peer review make sure the native speakers do as well
* Avoid the temptation to spend to much time on comments up front
* Avoid the temptation to put your docs into your identifiers
* Write about why it exists, not so much how it works
* Don't forget to include resource consumption considerations
