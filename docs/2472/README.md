# TransAmerica Trail on May 21st (after Assault on Mt. Mitchell)

I've decided to start my bike trip by riding to *Assault on Mt. Mitchell* and doing the entire climb with a fully loaded bike packing bike. There's a chance I won't finish within the cutoff time, but that's perfectly okay. Then I can just head up to connect with the TransAmerica Trail by biking through the most beautiful sections of the Blue Ridge Parkway and camping and working along the way. This will put me several hundred miles down the road to getting to Utah and stay with family by July.
