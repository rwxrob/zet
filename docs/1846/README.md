# What is KEG and why are you so obsessed with it right now?

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/cfXMuoaijQQ>

KEG, the Knowledge Exchange Graph specification is my answer to a modern Web that is completely broken for document exchange (for which it was originally designed). KEG nodes allow for distributed, flat databases as well without overcomplicated APIs. In fact, KEG is 100% network agnostic. KEGs can be shared with a simple USB drive.

I've been working on KEG a lot lately because I'm working on publishing my book: Terminal Velocity: Mastering the Fastest Human-Computer Interface. All the existing book authoring methods lack the ability to produce useful content for multiple mediums (web, GitHub `README.md`, etc.) KEG addresses this directly.

My zet (zettelkasten) content organization has been following the KEG specification for about a year now and I think it is ready to bake into an actual specification to be released in 2023.
