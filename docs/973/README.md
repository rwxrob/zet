# Go 101 Looks Pretty Damn Good, and Free

I just realized I haven't written a zet about this yet. But someone from
Twitch community pointed me at Go 101 (which has apparently been around
for years and I just missed it). The more I'm looking at it, the more I
like it. It is huge (600 printed pages) and should be called "Definitive
Go" (in the O'Reilly tradition) based on what I'm seeing of the content
and dry style so far, but I really like it. I particularly like that it
is in a constant state of online revision and covers Go 1.18 generics.
No other resource (besides the Go docs) does that at the moment.
