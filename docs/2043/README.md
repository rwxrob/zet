# Bike usage and repair plans

* Remove fenders and rack from gravel bike (Salsa Marrakesh).
* Convert townie into single-speed.
* Fix up Fisher mountain for single-track.

Concluded after seeing a nice bike with a stolen back wheel that taking my Marrakesh to Charlotte is a bad idea even with a lock because I have the rear wheel on quick-release to enable the Zwift Hub trainer. By using a townie in town with a bolted wheel I won't have as much risk of it being stolen and if so, just the cost to replace the wheel. (The entire bike was \$800. The Salsa was \1500.)
