I've found my sweet spot again, daily IRL urban/gravel adventure cycling on mostly paved roads to interesting places and around interesting poeple. Yesterday's round trip to Charlotte from Davidson took me seven hours, but it was absolute bliss the whole way (yes, even when I was exhausted). In fact, I was so happy on the entire route that I realized that is what I *really* want to do all the time, so much to explore and so many options even though it is the same-ish 80 mile journey every weekend.

* Went 35/3.25 to get to Charlotte having never ridden there yesterday
* That's 10.76 miles per hour in uncharted territory
* When I'm tired I don't mount the light I carried whole way, might as well mount it
* Nature trails where darker than most rides
* Only turn light on when in traffic, so mount on top of handlebars for eash access
* Almost zero dangerous traffic sections, mostly lonely open roads most with shoulder
* Need to get good cleaning up without a place to shower
* Biking the same urban route close to Doris allows for "rescues" if and when needed

Changes to IRL content and schedule:

* Biking to Critical Mass *every* last Friday (uptown interesting, Doris ride home)
* Round trip Davidson to Charlotte every Sunday (but only minimal uptown since boring)
* Focus on different cultural area every Sunday (NoDa, Birkdale, Camp Northend, Cornelius, etc.)
* So many interesting things to see on bike route, need to plan up to 12 hour streams
* Possibly reach out to travel and tourism board to promote
* "Find the stream sniper" game (bellum's idea)
* Group rides since route well known and covers large percentage of greater Charlotte region
* Saturdays open/recovery day for creating Twitch livestreaming creation of tech YouTube content
* Occasional long-trips when I have vacation days and budget for lodging

Also a lot of conclusions about gear and IRL streaming kit:

* Did not have sleep kit pannier which sped things up some but not much
* Definitely need to add full fenders for year-long rides/streaming
* Action 4 in good light still showing some acceptable vibration
* Action 4 sways side-to-side way more than the Pocket 3
* Action 4 low-light is absolutely horrendeous (which I already knew)
* Pocket 3 vibrations turn out to be same as Action 4
* Pocket 3 has way better sensor (1/2.3) than Action 4 (1/1.3)
* Pocket 3 destroys Action 4 in low-light (I have tons of evidence of this)
* Pocket 3 sucks in the rain, mechanical gimble immediately fails, can't waterproof
* Action 4 was good in 3 hours of rainstorm with taped up USB connection
* Pocket 3 is easier to monitor while mounted to handlebars
* Pocket 3 panning is much easier and also has much easier zoom
* No camera mounted to handlebars is able to use on-cam microphones, too much vibration
* Action 4 only takes one DJI 2 Mic transmitter forcing down-time to pair mic every time
* Action 4 does not automatically go into webcam mode
* Action 4 screen much harder to see and work with
* Pocket 3 allows ASMR stereo audio
* Concluded need to take both Action 4 and Pocket 3 on trips
* Bring a single microphone paired to Action 4 and two paired to Pocket 3
* Bring cables to keep microphones charged on long trips 
* Build around-neck binaural microphone harness with foam blocker in the middle and waterproofing
* Use Pocket 3 for everything except rain
* Turn microphone off when near camera to preserve BT connection (for bathrooms, etc.)
* Turn microphone back on when close to camera to prevent needing to pair it again
* When rain threatens enough to rain-cover rig also swap camera to Action 4
* USB-C to barrel  cable for Starlink vibrated itself to death, ordered new one
* Bring one of every single cable as spare on every ride
* Need to have at least two modems for leafy amazing trails where Starlink fails
* Need to keep Starlink for long country roads where no mobile coverage at all
* Monthly cost for optimal streaming rig: 2x80 Verizon, 1x150 Starlink = 310
* Can replace one 30,000 mAh Baseus with two 10,000 for each Nighthawk hotspot modem
* Always disable wifi on modems and use ethernet
