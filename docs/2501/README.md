# Ursacks are idiotic

Nothing screams, "I have no fucking idea what I'm doing out here" more than someone with an Ursack in bear country, okay, maybe someone asking for directions because they have no map or GPS (which actually happens). Unfortunately, as bikepacking picks up in popularity it is attracting more and more spandex-wearing-cyclists-turned-backcountry-wannabes who prioritize weight and fashion over the expert, legally-tested experience and recommendations of authorities from the National Parks Service who have dedicated their lives to living comfortably in the backcountry with wildlife of all kinds. I'll trust the pros and you should too. Not the Ursack bros saying stupid shit like, "Welcome to the team" in their misleading marketing videos. That company needs to fucking die before it gets someone killed.

All you need to know about Ursack as a company is that they actually sued the National Parks Service to get their product approved and lost because of the following reasons, which a judge upheld based on submitted evidence (which anyone can easily search for and confirm on the Internet):

* Ursacks were easily punctured by bear bites allowing bear saliva contamination.
* Ursacks have a rope allowing bear to carry it away.
* Ursacks tied to trees encouraged bears to destroy the tree.
* Ursacks with metal liners where destroyed leaving metal shards in the food.
* Smashed food and gear (cookware) in Ursack made it unusable.

Keep in mind that none of these things happen when you use an approved bear canister instead. You just stash the canister and if and when a bear finds it there is no way it can carry it away so it just leaves after trying to open it. An Ursack encourages a bear to hang around since it can puncture the container, smell the food punctured, and keep on ripping at it to get just enough to make it think it might have a chance eventually to get it all. All you have to do is watch a bear trying to open a canister vs an Ursack to see why these are obviously so inferior they aren't even worth the trouble and cost.

So what if approved bear canisters are ugly, heavy, and hard to carry. Tough shit. If you don't want to bother hanging your food (which works with *any* bag) get an approved canister and carry it.
