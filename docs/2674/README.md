# Trans America (Offroad) Trail is shit

Once upon a time I was tempted to attempt the off-road TAT popular with enduro and ATV people. Then I watched this video. Who the hell would actually enjoy crossing Oklahoma corn fields for days with absolutely no scenery and nothing but huge mud and sand sections, oh yeah, and the occasional motorhead doing 40 mph on a dirt road.

I had already had my doubts reading Sarah Swallow talk about the dog situation in many of the southern states, which was also confirmed by the adventure cycling guy in Mat's video as the reason the entire Kentucky section of the on-road TAT is infamous for people with serious dogs who enjoy tormenting cyclists. No fucking way. There are so many better places to ride, notably all the rail-trails and safer roads to the North, which also have more to see, better weather, and frankly just better people all around.
