# Bought the Wahoo KICKR Bike today

I found a way to finance the Wahoo KICKR Bike to lessen the shock of that 4430 dollar price tag so I went ahead and talked it over with wife who agreed and bought one. It's always tough to justify fitness toys for oneself. Our financial life is improving lately on several fronts so it seemed okay to continue the pursuit of best possible health to prevent health-related expenses later. We have also discovered ways to limit our monthly expenses by about 300 dollars (removing storage units, cancelling a few streaming services, etc.).

For what it's worth, I did wait for Wahoo to deny my sponsorship proposal. "We aren't accepting new sponsorship proposals," they said. I understand. I don't fault them for not wanting me even though I have directly influenced several others to purchase them as well.

Here's a summary of all the reasons I feel like a Wahoo KICKR Bike is perfect for my situation:

* Many people depend on me for their financial well-being.
* I'm relatively old but unable to retire for at least 10 years.
* I live in a country with really fucked up health care costs.
* Best way to reduce health care expense is to get and remain fit.
* Being in top fitness improves the quality of my paid work.
* Fitness requires balance with time for work, play, eating, and sleeping.
* Training from home is easiest and safest.
* Zwift allows me to meet other streaming/chatting goals while training.
* Quantity of training indoors is higher because of convenience.
* Quality of indoor training is better because more controlled.
* Swapping out the wheel and connecting to the Zwift Hub is annoying.
* I can work and train indoors at same time (conference calls, meetings).
* Expense of indoor training is controlled (no bike maintenance, expensive kit).
* I already have three bikes: mountain, gravel/adventure, urban.
* I don't really want or need fast/light road bike (no chance to use it).
* Zwift will be first Olympic E-Sport.
* Lots of people over 50 bike every day on Zwift (and I mean a *lot*).
* I can race more safely and easily with same level of training in Zwift.
* KICKR Bike is single most effective method of Zwift racing.
* KICKR Bike comes with highly accurate power meter.
