# 2024 Boost organized by specific skills, knowledge, abilities

In 2024, I'm returning to the SKILSTAK roots of building a "stack of skills."
All learning and work can be organized under three categories:

* Skills
* Knowledge
* Abilities

The process of coming up with a learning segment goes something like this:

1. Write skill as if a bulleted line in a job description
1. Break down the skill into procedure of tasks
1. Write each task like a skill as well
1. List any ability dependencies for task
1. Give knowledge required for task (terms, context, history, justification)
1. Break down larger skills into smaller ones
