# Need a Social Dashboard with Main People Followed

This `iam` project has spawned a lot of interesting ideas that I really
want to see made. I want to not only communicate my `.project` and
`.plan` but my current state in full detail. Then I want to subscribe to
a certain number of other people and have them all on a dashboard with
zoom in versions of their states/modes as well.

Ideally, this would be 'level one' of following someone on the Knowledge
Exchange Grid. Any level beyond this would include some form of caching
their current and latest Zettelkasten notes or manifest in order to
identify what they have that is new to talk about.
