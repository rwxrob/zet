# Personal publishing platform (`pub`)

Once upon a time I called this `live`, a way to manage all the ways that a person might want to "go live" on social media and streaming platforms. But now I realize it is part of a bigger suite of applications involving self-publishing in all forms of media, primarily written content. I've realized that written content is still king.

* It can be searched
* It is easy to alter and maintain
* It underlies all other content
* It is more sharable

It is super important that written content be considered fluid and changing. The current abysmal state of the Web is largely because so many have forgotten this core fact (to Tim Berners Lee's great chagrin).

So `pub` will be a single application that contains ways to publish content to everything there is out there in a modular way. This includes the regular big services:

* KEG
* GitHub
* YouTube
* Twitch
* Mastodon
* Twitter

It will take a really long time to get `pub` anywhere near done, but it's the long term goal after the other main Go projects of 2023 are done.
