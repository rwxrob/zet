# Personal publishing platform (`pub`)

The `pub` is the second half of `keg.pub`. It's all the commands to generate and share KEG content (but not the stuff to query it, that is in [`mim`](../1955)).

It is super important that published, written content be considered fluid and changing. The current abysmal state of the Web is largely because so many have forgotten this core fact (to Tim Berners Lee's great chagrin).

So `pub` will be a single application that contains ways to publish content to everything there is out there in a modular way. This includes the regular big services:

* KEG
* GitHub
* YouTube
* Twitch
* Mastodon
* Twitter

For some of these, it will be just a matter of sending a notification (by way of [`mim`](../1955). It will take a really long time to get `pub` anywhere near done, but it's the long term goal after the other main Go projects of 2023 are done.
