# Alacritty is Broken Beyond Usefulness (For Me)

Although I hate writing all of this, I just have to record that
Alacritty is sadly broken. The most annoying thing was recently I
was using it on Windows in full screen and when any notification fired
off it would force Alacritty terminal not only to screw up rendering,
but would scroll the screen buffer even with scrolling was disabled. As
far as I can tell, this only happened in full-screen mode.

Normally, this isn't an issue because "why the fuck are you using
Windows" but one of Alacritty's greatest claims is that it just works
everywhere and with "a common configuration" (which I do absolutely
love). But this claim is destroyed when it just doesn't work.

I probably should take the time to report this as an issue, but I just
do not want to spent all that time for something that matters so little.
Instead, I have Windows Terminal working perfectly (despite its many
bugs as well) even though I absolutely hate that you are required to
use the GUI just to find the JSON file that I want to edit from the
terminal. It's completely ass-backwards.

I could care less about other things like ligature support and even
forgive Alacritty for not supporting the full Unicode character set
(including important terminal escapes for adding some effects such as
blink, which I noticed when my broken symbolic links stopped blinking).
