Zwift is turning out to be the thing that saves me from old age and my own ambition to do so many other things. I'm too old to run any more. I fucking hate admitting that, but the 10k I ran yesterday knocked me out for an entire day. Who knows, as my bike fitness gets better and I drop the extra 20kilos (1/4 of my current total weight) maybe my joints and stuff will be able to take the stress even though I'm older. None of those connective tissues are anywhere near where they need to be and they take years to build up even in youth. So just biking for now. It's the least stress on all that stuff and is by far the best way to burn calories while building muscle in a safe way, that and some body-weight strength stuff once a week for the upper body.

I have to remember nothing else matters if my health keeps deteriorating at the rate it did from 2020-2023. I *must* stop and reverse that. No amount of tech home lab and Go coding and book authoring will ever make up for that, and given the fact that my job is 100% sedentary, with high stress levels, and streaming usually stresses me out as well, 2 hours a day of physical activity is *the minimum* I need to counter it. This stuff has to become the new normal.
