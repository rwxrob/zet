I've decided that after we get finally all our stuff moved in, including shifting to yet another storage unit that is in Davidson, that I'll finally be free to start using those random four day weekends for some adventure cycling expeditions, probably one every other month. Turns out planning for a four-day bike tour is the exact perfect kit to regularly carry around on Keshy since it is so minimal. It is heavy enough to load Keshy up (like her frame likes) but not more. Provided I will normally be staying in some type of shelter, no heavy sleep system is required, neither is any remote office computer stuff (which, at this point, is just a laptop which I could just carry as a messenger bag if I really wanted).
