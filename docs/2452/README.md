# Recipe: green smoothie

* 1 peeled navel orange
* 2 peeled mandarin oranges
* 1 apple with skin
* 1 cup frozen spinach
* 1 cup frozen strawberries
* 1/2 cup frozen blueberries
* 1/2 regular size cucumber with skin
* 3 baby carrots
* 2 limes with pulp (reamed)

Cut up everything so it will fit in your Blendtec blender (don't even try this in anything less than a Blendtec). Run it through the "smoothie" setting *twice* (otherwise you will get little bits of annoying carrot, trust me).

Don't skip the cucumber. The anti-inflammatory benefits of cucumbers are ridiculously good, not to mention the polyphenols, vitamins, and other stuff.
