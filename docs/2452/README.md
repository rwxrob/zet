# Recipe: green smoothie

* 1 peeled navel orange
* 2 peeled mandarin oranges
* 1 apple with skin
* 1 cup frozen spinach
* 1/2 cup frozen strawberries
* 1/2 cup frozen blueberries
* 1/2 regular size cucumber with skin
* 2 baby carrots (or equiv)
* 1 lime with pulp (reamed)
* ice (if wanted, frozen stuff usually enough)
* a little water

Cut up everything so it will fit in your Blendtec blender (don't even try this in anything less than a Blendtec). Run it through the "smoothie" setting *twice* (otherwise you will get little bits of annoying carrot, trust me).

I have a [40-oz Simply Modern Tumbler](https://amzn.to/3SBJ4Sg) made of stainless steal that can always take the 32+ ounces that this usually turns out to be. I dump the smoothie in the tumbler and immediately rinse off the Blendtec stuff which easily washes away (no sticky stuff). Then I suck on it while catching up with lunch-time news, social media and stuff.

***Do not use BPA plastic containers for anything---especially a citrus smoothie with natural acids that will leech the BPA.***

Note that the frozen stuff will be bulky because of the frozen water around it. It's hard to measure so just estimate.

Don't skip the cucumber. The anti-inflammatory benefits of cucumbers are ridiculously good, not to mention the polyphenols, vitamins, and other stuff.

**WARNING:** *Never* add banana to any smoothie that contains any other fruit at all! Bananas are well-known to destroy the chemical composition specifically of polyphenols that (along with the vitamins and soluble fiber) are the reason you should eat fruits and veggies in the first place.

I may have added vodka (the "healthiest" of the alcohols) to this in the past (for a special occasion) and I have no idea what its effect on the polyphenols was, only its affect on me. üòÅ
