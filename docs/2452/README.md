# Recipe: green smoothie

* 3 peeled mandarin oranges
* 1 apple with skin (no core)
* 1 cup frozen spinach
* 1/2 cup frozen strawberries
* 1/2 cup frozen blueberries
* 1/4 regular size cucumber with skin (or 1 small cucumber)
* 2 medium size celery stalks
* 3 baby carrots (or equiv)
* 1 lime with pulp (reamed)
* ice (if wanted, frozen stuff usually enough)
* a little water

Cut up everything so it will fit in your Blendtec blender (don't even try this in anything less than a Blendtec). Run it through the "smoothie" setting *twice* (otherwise you will get little bits of annoying carrot, trust me).

I have a [40-oz Simply Modern Tumbler](https://amzn.to/3SBJ4Sg) made of stainless steal that can always take the 32+ ounces that this usually turns out to be. I dump the smoothie in the tumbler and immediately rinse off the Blendtec stuff which easily washes away (no sticky stuff). Then I suck on it while catching up with lunch-time news, social media and stuff.

***Do not use BPA plastic containers for anything---especially a citrus smoothie with natural acids that will leech the BPA.***

Note that the frozen stuff will be bulky because of the frozen water around it. Run frozen stuff under water to remove the ice. Rather than use an actual measuring cup I just use a handful usually.

## Pre-prepare in re-usable Ziploc bags

All the ingredients can be bought fresh and stored in a Ziploc bag in the freezer. Then you can just pull out that bag after yoga in the morning and blend it up with some filtered water. Just makes the fuss of making a smoothie a little less.

## Keep cucumber and celery

Don't skip the cucumber and celery. The anti-inflammatory benefits of these are ridiculously good, not to mention the polyphenols, vitamins, and other stuff.

## No bananas

**WARNING:** *Never* add banana to any smoothie that contains any other fruit at all! Bananas are well-known to destroy the chemical composition specifically of polyphenols that (along with the vitamins and soluble fiber) are the reason you should eat fruits and veggies in the first place.

## Just one part of daily diet

I also do at least one protein/peanut butter/banana smoothie and some guacamole with lots of vegetables during the day. I eat dates and pecans for sweet snacks with coffee and drink tumeric plus ginger tea throughout the day. Whatever we are having for dinner as a family I just go with unless it is seriously fried, then I just do my own thing.
