# Heart rate zones and "the talk test"

In this great article from the Cleveland Clinic the idea of heart rate zones is well-explained for a complete beginner. I've been obsessing about all the science of endurance sports since 1984, but it's good to read that most of it hasn't changed in all that time. The best way to tell your target heart-rate zone is the good ol' 220-age chart. Mine is 165 based on that meaning my target heart-rate zone is between 83-140 (even though I've been spending a fair amount of time at 150+ on the bike lately).

The VO2 max method is more accurate, but wicked difficult to get right. It doesn't help that the only perfect way to do it is by running on a treadmill with a face-mask on while scientists measure your actual levels.

Honestly, the most important thing about a heart-rate monitor to me is to help me restore a scientifically backed sense of perceived exertion again. This is by far the easiest for me to track. The "talk test" is much easier than anything else. If you cannot have a light conversation while exercising then you are definitely not in your target heart rate, which is nice since I'm usually streaming and want to talk to people while biking.

Once again, Twitch is good for me. By talking through my bike sessions about whatever I actually keep my exertion levels in check automatically. That's right. Talking is *good* for me when working out. It keeps me in the right zone, and provided the subject matter isn't stressful, increases my dopamine levels as well, nerdy stuff, but worth knowing about.
