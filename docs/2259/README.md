# What's better? Zoom, Discord, or Slack for coworking?

I have an honest question: what is the best place to build a community of people who are streaming their coworking sessions. I know some do it in Discord, others Slack, others Zoom. But what is most likely to be something everyone can do freely that won't get abused?

I did notice that Zoom support use of virtual cameras so that is definitely the high-bar to meet. Virtual cameras are really mandatory anytime after Covid.
