# Monthly cycling expenses

* <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTKiLKiBvggVrE0_sW0HjkKnHIKAMO5phzfgnzpyMTHCDyZoK4-1MA_NNOVQUyrNElANX5AzqNgUZjG/pubhtml>

All things considered, the annual cost of getting to and from a favorite safe cycling route five times a week and two Zwift indoor sessions per week is less than $1000 per year ($80/month). A good gym membership is about $70/month (Planet Fitness is $30). Plus I'd still have to drive to a gym. Cycling comes with a lot of other expenses to maintain the bike and clothing and stuff, but that's not bad.
