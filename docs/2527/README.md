# Didn't you say you weren't streaming any more?

Saturday, February 17, 2024, 2:58:08AM EST

This week I've been feeling the call back to do more educational streaming. For some reason when the world is going to shit and I have to deal with people who are professionals but lack basic command-line and Linux tech skills the old "don't get mad, get busy" comes to mind. I really believe that shit. Hopefully, someone will print it on whatever the equivalent of my tombstone would be (but I really would rather just donate my body to help others and have the rest cremated, but what a morbid topic that is).

## Why can I stream again and I gave it up before?

Change of plans. Earlier in the year I was very, very seriously pursuing a digital nomad by bike lifestyle and I made it work for a few weeks to test it out, but ultimately the demands of living on the road and a bike and never knowing where you are going to sleep and stay and have Internet access just isn't conducive to full-time tech employment. I still believe it can be done. I honestly do. I just don't have the energy anymore to keep experimenting with what it takes. Just the single act of planning where I will be living every two weeks is exhausting enough all by itself.

Plus riding a bike as a bike tourist and traveller is not at all the same as riding a bike because you like to ride bikes. Bike touring is boring. I'd rather be going top speed in a peloton or jumping off hills and berms on a trail bike or bikepacking in the most remote areas I can be taking it all in slowly. Every single one of those things I just mentioned is 100% not conducive to working and living from all the gear on my bike. Just living from a bike is hard enough, let alone the prospect of finding wifi and such and not getting killed by vagrants and traffic.

Bottom line: since I'm no longer living from my bike I have more time at home. I'm more stable. And regular streaming educational content demands stability.

## Are you still biking?

Hell yes. More than ever before. I just don't have far-flung destinations in mind. The call of the road is every bit as real inside me. I'm tortured by it. My wanderlust is critical and chronic. But the best I can do for now is confine it to 3-day trips and the occasional time off of work. In fact, one reason I want to get so regular about the annual content is I want to know what weeks I can take off to do the Tour Divide or whatever other major event I want to do. But, honestly, I would rather to a really amazing week of supported riding getting as pampered as a person on a cruise ship while I just worry about the bike than even a full month off exploring places. I do love that, just not as much as I would love to tour German, for example, over two weeks and have the entire thing be "credit card touring" instead. Like my wife says, "I'm outside-y, not outdoors-y." As for me, I'm kinda both.
