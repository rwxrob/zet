# Steel for the win, with two wheelsets

After doing a bit more research it turns out that a steel bicycle frame is still better for most of my priorities:

* Dampens road bumps without giving up too much stiffness
* Not as good for aluminum and carbon for sprinting, but meh
* Takes getting bonked in stride (doesn't crack)
* Much safer and less likely to fail at high speed
* Has a much longer lifespan in general
* Weight is *far* less important than people think
* Can be combined with light/fast wheels
* So much cheaper than aluminum and carbon it's ridiculous

Once again, a touring rig turns out to be best for everything I want long term. I'm more inclinded to go exploring and being able to swap out a touring/gravel strong bike wheelset for a faster/aero wheelset is far better than considering multiple bikes. At the end of the day, my bike is my "ship" on which I set sail to explore at different speeds and levels depending on the terrain. It is far more important that the ship remain "sea-worthly" than fast, but having the ability to throw a different sail to get a turbo effect and increase in speed that's perfect.
