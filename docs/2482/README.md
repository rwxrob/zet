# Full-frame bags are apparently horrible in high cross winds

So glad I watched a video of a guy who has done 40,000 miles of touring in his life. He pointed out how wind is the enemy most of the time more than gravity and wondered how anyone with a full-frame pack does blow over, or worse, get blown into traffic.
