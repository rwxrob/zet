# Don't tether Netgear Nighthawk hotspot modems

A reminder to use Ethernet or WIFI dongles (never tethering). I have to laugh at people that complain about the nighthawks overheating while also suggesting that they tether them. Tethering *always* puts the modem into "charging" mode.

There are complicated, broken ways to use a cable that doesn't blocks that but then you have annoying cables to deal with that come disconnected when moving around and go bad.

The best solution is to just use the hotspot as God intended, with a WIFI dongle or Ethernet. I use one on Ethernet and two others on WIFI dongles and that allows me to not even use them if I have a good WIFI provider around (for around the house, or pub, or library, etc.) The m5/m6 can *easily* handle all the WIFI interference from a huge event. I've very successfully streamed using this method from the middle of a parade with thousands of people in the heart of Charlotte with tons of businesses with WIFI all around and everyone with their phones out capturing the event. The m5/m6 is well-regarded as the gold standard in hotspots and since the WIFI dongle is often inches away from the hotspot there is never a problem.
