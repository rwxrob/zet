# Considering a cell signal booster

After watching Jayhobo on Twitch the other day and seeing his [cell signal booster setup][booster]. I'm considering getting one and using for special occasions when biking into areas that have virtually no signal, such as the state park and mountain bike trails in the area. Generally, it doubles the bars on all the modems and phones next to it when he has it on. This is the same tech used by long-haul truckers to keep their signals high. I could even run the antenna up like a flag from a rear rack for really remote things like when crossing the country.
