# Keycloak OIDC provider joins CNCF

After hearing from internal DoD people that Keycloak is more or less mandatory for DoD work it's not surprising to read that it has become an "incubating" project for the CNCF (according to taniwha). This is nice to hear because despise the use of dated Java technology and design, Keycloak is much better to use than Authentik and other tools that do not support legacy `grant_type=password` and other things required by larger enterprises still tied to older LDAP authentication strategies (for at least another 10 years).
