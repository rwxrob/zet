# Bonzai is Working, Just Missing Help

Happy to report that Bonzai is working as designed except for the Help
documentation (waiting on PEGN code generator for BonzaiMark) and some
minor but with the comp.File completer. I'm in the process of porting
all my bash scripts and utilities into a binary called `cmds` (that I
will hard link to `z` as well).
