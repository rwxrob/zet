# Watch the development of Mojo language

Even though it is going through growing pains, the new mojo language is definitely one to watch---particularly since it comes form well-established Python folk and the creator of LLVM and *is compiled*. We are looking at a potential language to rule the world of AI ML model coding as well as all of microservices. One thing it famously does is abstract CUDA optimizations (which no other language on the planet does currently).
