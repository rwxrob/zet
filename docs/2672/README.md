I rode and livestreamed for several hours in probably the most intense downpour I've ever streamed or even ridden in. The drops were huge and it was literally like I was taking a shower at some points. I'm happy to say that all the electronics made it through without a problem using the rain protection I'd been preparing for months.

* Biking to Charlotte isn't even that hard (just 36 miles)
* Seriously intense thunderstorm turned much of the paved trail into slippery mud
* Weekend round-trip adventures to Charlotte and back are totally doable
* Ass-saver front fender is far too small to protect bike from gravel grit
* Zip-lock plastic bag over phone and garmin worked surprisingly well
* DWR tent bag with both compression and opening closure straps worked perfect for IRL rig
* Tent bag is also highly visible color increasing visibility on front of bike
* Nothing overheated when covered even without fan
* Action 4 protected with tape over the USB connection made it several hours in pouring rain
* DJI Mic 2 failed after three hours from battery and almost impossible to use backup cuz couldn't pair in rain
* Only way to pair Action 4 with new mic is to unplug camera or cut power to belabox
* Gaffer tape eventually failed holding USB to Action 4 (well after ride)
* Doris recommended [mouldable glue](https://a.co/d/gTHc3o3) instead of hotglue to replace tape
* Going to use mouldable glue on both ends of Action 4 USB cable connector
* Action 4 image is meh in the lower-light of the storm (need to lock down frame rate next time)
* I will immediately buy an Action 5 with bigger sensor and better low-light (if rumors pan out)
* Bought [SKS full front fender and rear (again)](https://a.co/d/07YIb6k) now that running 38 mm gravel tires
* Riding without the rig on my back/chest was bliss and much easier logistically
* Bought ethernet cable to route from rig to Starlink to reduce power/quirks from a wifi dongle
* Realizing I could use the larger/heavier panniers and be fine (so DNB hauling laptop might still happen)
* Ortlieb big panniers have external pouches perfect for rain gear access
* Decided Keshy will be just for road bike touring and livestreaming

That last one about committing my beloved Keshy to just adventure cycling on mostly paved roads and trails was a huge decision, but I'm confident it is the right one. I'm never streaming with a backpack from the bike again. It's just not worth it. After just a few rides without the heavy IRL backpack on I realize just what a huge difference it is. That comfort and easy setup make me want to ride and stream more and at the end of the day more riding and streaming is always better than randomly being able to stream going into a store or restaurant. Besides, with all the gear I have on Keshy that I'm carrying with me I am *never* leaving her alone for any significant amount of time. Having the live camera on the bike should terrify most would-be thieves because they know they are being captured. Plus the bike is a perfect moveable tripod for getting great shots.

Eventually I can use the other tires on another future bike. My beautiful [Salsa Marrakesh](https://www.salsacycles.com/bikes/2017_marrakesh_dropbar_deore_orange) is, after all, a (heavy) touring bike with a very low bottom bracket. If and when I ever did anything that it could not do (like Tour Divide) I would defintely just get another bike. But here's the thing, I don't *want* to do anything I cannot live stream, and live streaming with a camera attached to the bike is just best when the vibrations are at an absolute minimum. 

After yesterday's very successful but very wet ride, I'm emboldened more than ever to plan much longer adventure cycling trips and take my remote office with me. Perhaps my DNB dreams are still alive. Once I have the budget to stay in a hotel at least every three days I think I would be totally golden.
