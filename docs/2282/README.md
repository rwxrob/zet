# Go documentation format has been updated to be markdown-ish

I guess I missed this stuff in the release notes. Notably, headings are now marked off with hash tags (`# heading`) like markdown. I noticed this when my Go formatter automatically detected it and forced it to be there. Apparently, this was added in 1.19.
