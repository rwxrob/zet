# Bonzai AI for CLI, Remove Diseased GetOpt Brain

We live in an AI world. Everything is getting smart about completion. We
type emails that predict what our next sentence will be. We play games
that make intelligent decisions about our hero builds. We even complete
our very code while writing it with the best possible version of what we
are thinking about writing. Why then wouldn't we want to embrace AI for
our terminal command line interactions, UNIX, Linux, PowerShell,
whatever?

Bonzai supports intelligent, dynamic completion based on the specific
leaf Completer function. It depends on the developer, could be standard
completion (`comp-cmd`) or `comp-file` or `comp-calc` or `comp-cal` or
`comp-week` but even cooler than that, it could be `comp-ai` which
includes an AI trained model in the possible command completion, all
from just tapping `<tab>`.

Why the fuck would anyone want `getopt` shit over that?

And, why would they clutter up a perfectly beautiful, speakable command
line with dash shit?

The answer to why is because they still have a diseased GetOpt zombie
brain and haven't opened their minds up to the new world of intelligent,
intelligible command line interfaces, command line completers that are
as smart as the best AI humans can provide, and eventually, perhaps, as
smart as us. Soon our AI Bonzai completers will be guessing what
commands we want to use based on the time of day and the weather. It's
not fantasy, it's fucking possible, today.

Time for me to learn more Go machine learning.
