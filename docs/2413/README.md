# Starlink in its own cargo case is least annoying

It might be bulkier and create more wind noise and less gas mileage, but being able to remove the entire case and add it to another vehicle, or to avoid trees and overhangs is absolutely worth it. Not having to find places for all the components to live is also another hassle this solution completely avoids. The case solution works with *any* carrying rig of any kind including trailers, trucks, and roof racks. Hell, I could even toy this is a trailer with a Jackery 300 and a 200w solar panel behind my bike.
