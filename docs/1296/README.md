# So RWXPodCast is *Not* Me

Was in my podcast app looking for RWX stuff thinking maybe some of my
other content would have made it into it when I find the [RWXPodCast].
From the looks of it they have no idea that I exist. But it is really
comical how close some of their topics are to stuff I've covered live
since December 2019. (They started in September 2020.)

At one point I was seriously pursuing a community of RWX community
members. That was what <https://rwx.gg> was about. I wanted to take on
the problem of education by promoting as many people helping share
knowledge as possible. It is maybe possible that they heard some of that
at some point. Either way, I'm glad they are doing what they are doing,
even if I've gone in an entirely different direction now with the Boost
and other stuff.

Of course, this leaves me to figure out what to call the podcast. I
suppose the best name will just be rwxrob, after all, as much as I enjoy
the community aspect, for some reason it does come back to me keeping it
moving so might as well. Besides, I'm going to be taking some pretty
direct attacks on specific bad ideas (and the most popular people
spewing them) putting out absolutely dangerous information and I would
never be okay with having others be tarnished by those attacks.  They
sure as hell don't mind doing it to others. Someone has to defend the
truth that will get and keep you a job and provide the best possible use
of your precious cognitive resources.
