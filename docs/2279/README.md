# Zorchenhimer (and the gang) have cracked "movie nights"

Don't get mad, get busy. That's what they did. They pretty much said, "Fuck Twitch!" and just made an application for chatting and streaming that everyone can participate in. Apparently, Dennis (lastmiles) is also using this. I gotta say, I'm blown away at how cool it is. Of course, it's made in Go and was created rather rapidly. It leverages Webassembly for the in-browser client, and now that Go can compile into Webassembly we are going to see a lot more of this.

This has me wondering if Cozy Collaborator could actually have it's own integrated server for video streaming and a full chat client eventually. Then we just have to relay stuff from Twitch and Discord in an authenticated way into the central server. That way Cozy wouldn't be dependent on any specific service.
