# The power of comfy, warm socks

I've never owned a pair of socks more comfortable than Yeblues Merino Wool. I mean, they have the perfect thickness and are not too tight like other socks. Obviously, you can't wash these with high heat or it destroys them. I'm just so happy wearing them (yes with sandals).
