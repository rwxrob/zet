# Main categories of livestreaming content

I've been working out what is the best livestreaming content for four years at this point and I've (once again) concluded that the following are mine main preferred formats for live content:

## Over-the-shoulder DJ

* Music from playlists I curate on Spotify and rotate by weekday
* Full screen of whatever I am doing on my computer (usually laptop)
* Monitor the chat on my phone occasionally
* Stickers and Blerp on just to keep it fun

## Solo torso studio

Face cam and voice actively reading and responding directly to chat. 

## Solo face focused

Face and/or keyboard cam in corner while main focus is full screen.

## Group panel:


## Group focused:


## IRL POV

## IRL torso

## Conclusions

I realize there are a lot of formats that others prefer and use. I personally do not do a lot of group and interview content but I'm planning to change that significantly in the future---especially now that the laptop is completely portable and I can take it on site with dual DJI mics.
