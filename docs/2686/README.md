# 2024 main categories of livestreaming content

I've been working out what is the best livestreaming content for four years at this point and I've (once again) concluded that the following are mine main preferred formats for live content (arranged by how often they happen):

**Stalk my screen**
No mic, no topic, themed musical playlists, silent VODs (since all audio discarded)

**IRL POV outdoor adventure cycling** 
DJI Action 4, Pocket 3 with mic and Belabox

**Studio audience**
Full studio mic and cam, recording for YouTube, usually tech videos

**Yoga DJ**
Old man doing yoga with yoga music on, DJ category means no VODs/clips allowed

**Interviews**
Two good mics, long-form, lots of questions

**Old man on the street**
One handheld mic asking people stuff IRL, with camera on chest, a creepy favorite, oddly frequently helping homeless people

**Gaming**
Traditional Twitch stream playing Dota 2, Overwatch, or Minecraft usually

The screen stalking from the laptop from wherever I am is really something new. I even shaved this morning on stream, lol. This could be very, very dangerous. My wife loves it though. She knows she is never on the stream but can "bomb" me any time by sticking her face in front of the screen. It also means I can work on a lot of coding projects I have been putting off at night in the wee early morning hours when I get my best coding done usually while laying next to her here. It also doesn't have to be scheduled so I can just find someplace cozy and nice, grab my laptop and headphones and phone and turn on stream.
