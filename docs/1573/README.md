# Tribute to Aaron Swartz

Everything I do regarding the spread of learning and knowledge is
dedicated to the life and mission of Aaron Swartz. Were he here today
he'd likely be doing something along the same lines. He'd probably have
already created his version of KEG. I have dreams of spending an
afternoon sipping beverages and conversing with him and Lawrence Lessig
about changing the world, more. Aaron is one of those few for whom the
trite phrase "too good for this world" really applies. I hope everyone
will watch [The Internet's Own Boy][aaron] to understand why.
