# Twitch coding community thoughts


Just noticed "programmer_live" is just a rerun of a person doing CSS (poorly). They have it on a loop and have an "ASMR" tag. Here's the thing, I think it's great. I even gifted them 100 bits. That was when I noticed they aren't even there. Another viewer and I played with the chat a bit to get them to even notice. Nothing.

Then I remembered they were working on the same Starbuck's site the last time. Then I noticed the loop. Could it be the world's best viral marketing from Starbuck's? If so that social media marketing person deserves some kind of award. They created the trolliest possible name, then pretend to "live" code on a Starbuck's site infiltrating the subconscious of the entire "Software and Game Development" category by getting pushed by the Twitch main page (which is how others found out about it as well). Hell, Twitch could even be in on it making all kinds of ad dollars without telling a single person.

Wait a second, I need to get some coffee now...

So here's the question:

**Is there value in doing reruns of actual coding when I'm not here?**

There are a flood of questions and comments that come from this.

## Is it still okay with Twitch to do reruns at all?


## Are reruns off-putting or desirable?


## Are reruns better than just music and ASCII fishes?

## Is another channel needed?
