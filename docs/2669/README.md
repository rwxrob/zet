# Twitch reruns of coding?

The short answer is no. Reruns are *not* interactive and "livestreaming" by definition is "live" (which reruns are not). People come to Twitch overwhelmingly for live content and live interaction with living people/things (if we count the ducks and stuff). The AI stuff just doesn't count.

Why am I wondering this?

Just noticed "programmer_live" is just a rerun of a person doing CSS (poorly). They have it on a loop and have an "ASMR" tag. Here's the thing, I think it's great. I even gifted them 100 bits. That was when I noticed they aren't even there. Another viewer and I played with the chat a bit to get them to even notice. Nothing.

Then I remembered they were working on the same Starbuck's site the last time. Then I noticed the loop. Could it be the world's best viral marketing from Starbuck's? If so that social media marketing person deserves some kind of award. They created the trolliest possible name, then pretend to "live" code on a Starbuck's site infiltrating the subconscious of the entire "Software and Game Development" category by getting pushed by the Twitch main page (which is how others found out about it as well). Hell, Twitch could even be in on it making all kinds of ad dollars without telling a single person.

Wait a second, I need to get some coffee now...

So here's the question: **Is there value in doing reruns of actual coding when I'm not here?**

Again, the short answer is "no." Anything anyone would ever want to watch will be better from my YouTube channel where I've had a chance to edit out some of the randomness. And for those times when people just need a place to hang out while doing something out, the "co-whatever" type of stuff, well for that I can just put on music and fishies or music and me writing or actually working on something. There is enough stuff that I do personally on the computer every day that doing it live, even if it is just mundane stuff, with music on in the background (like right now), is probably plenty.

There's an "Always On" category that streams re-runs of TV shows (against TOS technically, but whatever). Still, these are not reruns of previous streams attempting to troll people into thinking they are really sitting there.
