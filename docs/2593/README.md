# Managing failure

One way to stay motivated and positive is to allow myself to fail, often. Every failure leads to another lesson learned.

## Prepare for critical failures

A few types of failure are critical. You die if you aren't prepared for them. These are the failures that terrify most people to the point they would never dream of attempting even a modest adventure by bike:

* Hypothermia/hyperthermia
* Frostbite
* Grizzly attack
* Rattlesnake bite
* Stranded in the middle of no where
* Starvation/dehydration
* Getting run over
* Murder/mugging

## Most failures are not catastrophic

What does most failure look like? Not every failure involves losing your front teeth or being air evacuated. In fact, most failures a much simpler:

* Misjudging the weather
* Overexerting
* Eating the wrong food
* Not drinking enough water
* Picking a bad route
* Forgetting an important task or routine
* Over scheduling
* Missing a meeting
* Stubbing my toe
* Dropping or breaking something important

Eliminating as many of these small failures is really the challenge of DNB living, it's the logistical challenge that makes it fun, which is why it takes a unique personality type to even attempt it. Most consider objecting oneself to that much discomfort and work to not just not be fun, but insane (like my wife).
