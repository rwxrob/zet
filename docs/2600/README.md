# DNB battery conservation strategy

* Use phone for as many things as possible (Slack, Webex, Web w/ VPN)
* Use best-in-class, small laptop for work (request if available)
* Use RealVNC to remotely access high-power computing lab running at home
* If required work laptop has bad battery life, bring own, only use when needed
    * Install Slack and Webex on "personal" laptop to conserve battery
* If required work laptop has great battery life, just bring one, use RealVNC
* Don't forget to turn everything off when not being used
* Never recharge battery bricks from power station

Consider that the Macbook Pro 14" M3 can run for 18 hours on one charge. The old i7 16" only runs for about four hours. So it would take two additional, full 65w Baseus battery bricks to power the i7 16" weighing three lbs total. Since the 14" weighs 3.6 lbs it is much better than lugging around addition bricks just for the i7 if the 14" can be used for as many work things as possible. In fact, I could just leave the i7 home and plugged in so that it can be accessed with RealVNC from anywhere with the lighter laptop. All the conferencing/calling software that I require can be run from a personal laptop. This option even allows me to work on the official company laptop from my phone remotely.
