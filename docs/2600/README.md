# DNB battery conservation strategy

* Use phone for as many things as possible
* Use best-in-class, small laptop for work (request if available)
* Use RealVNC to remotely access high-power computing lab running at home
* If required work laptop has bad battery life, bring own, only use when needed
    * Install Slack and Webex on "personal" laptop to conserve battery
* If required work laptop has great battery life, just bring one, use RealVNC 
* Don't forget to turn everything off when not being used
* Never recharge battery bricks from power station
