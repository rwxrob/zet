# Random thoughts on Zwift streaming

* Twitch people don't like to watch cyclists, Zwift category says it all
* Zwift people don't like to watch Twitch streamers
* Running can't be streamed (without a treadmill)
* Treadmill's are boring to watch, unless you *like* Zwift
* Still worth it to stream Zwift cycling? yes
* Going to stream to Zwift category where people are not idiots (like Just Chatting)
