# 2022 Boost with Feature Go Bonzai™ Programming

One of the hardest things to get beginners to internalize is a sense of
motivation about what they are creating. In the past I've used memes and
made it fun and mnemonically valuable, but I'm going to try something
entirely different this year for the 2022 Boost. I'm going to do all the
Go programming using useful Bonzai™ commands so that people *start* with
something that is immediately practical and portable.

Creating Bonzai branch commands is very addicting --- especially since
you can collect branches of composable commands from others and add them
to your own. This collector mentality --- coupled with the fact that you
can create collectable things yourself --- is what I'm betting will
drive these beginning Go developers to want to add more, crafting their
Bonzai trees with the same motivation and intensity as one would a
bonsai tree in real life.

Each project need not be huge, but it immediately makes FOSS
contributors out of even the humblest beginner. So the next step is to
identify (and design) a set of commands that will give a sufficient
introduction to all the types and basic constructs of the Go language.
Some of the commands will still be fun, like an animation command.
