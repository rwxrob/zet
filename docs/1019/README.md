# Books I want to write

I've always been a fan of books even though technical books regularly suffer from falling out of date. Books are *still* a better comprehensive resource than wikis because they are written with a consistent voice and reader in mind and are (usually) edited better.

That said, the books I write will always be free online with paper equivalents in print (like No Starch Press).

1.  Knowledge Exchange Graphs: Manage Knowledge Like Software with KEG
2.  Terminal Velocity: Mastering the Fastest Human-Computer Interface
3.  Bonzai, Building Stateful Command Tree Interfaces with Go
4.  Autodidactic, How to Succeed as a Knowledge Worker
5.  Good to Gig, Surviving the “Radical” New Sharing Economy
6.  Programming with Purpose: Coding for Self-Empowerment
7.  Works for Me, Modern Collaborative Developer Practices
8.  PEGN: Parsing Expression Grammar Notation
9.  SKILSTAK, Learning to Help Others Learn
10. There and Never Back Again, A Former Mormon’s Tale
