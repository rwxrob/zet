# Udemy Gave the Refund Immediately, I Like That

I've been toying with Udemy for a while. If nothing more it is a way to
get content out to more people (even if it isn't really a sustainable
business model). The more I see content on YouTube and Twitch and Udemy
the more I realize there is just so much stuff that isn't based on any
practical work experience whatsoever. It just keeps me fired up. I have
quite a bit, but the people we *really* want to hear from are way too
busy making amazing things to ever come up for air and produce a Udemy
course with pretty graphics, write a book, or even fail publicly on a
live stream working on topics together. It's a damn shame really.

Anyway, the fact that Udemy immediately gave me that refund makes me
wonder if maybe I could cleanup some live stream content and just throw
it into a course there at some point. If nothing more it would force me
to structure it more. There is a dire need for Beginner Boost content
because all the existing content assumes you already learned Linux (to
varying degrees without any agreement on what that actually means).
