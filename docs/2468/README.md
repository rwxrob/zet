# Vlogging routine

I'm learning a lot about vlogging best practices having been all about the live streaming before (even though I still plan on doing some live streams on occasion).

1. Setup action cam to do 1080p vertical 30fps.
1. Collect a bunch of clips throughout the day.
1. Load clips into DaVinci next morning over coffee
1. Edit them to under eight minutes total, add overlays, etc.
1. Export using Low to keep under 1 gigabyte.
1. Post to Instagram and YouTube from Web.
1. Share to Facebook from app.
