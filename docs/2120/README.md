# Fast glucose for recovery and fueling

Take a look at the ingredients of the following two products on Amazon without reading too much about the description and see if you can spot *any* differences:

Now look at the price and descriptions. It would be hilarious if it weren't so damned depressing. Call something a health "energy" product and bottle it up and you can resell cheap candy to stupid people.

Dextrose (D-Glucose) is the most common form of quickly digestible sugar that will turn into glycogen in your muscles and liver (when consumed in proper amounts). Most gels have about the same ingredients of frosting mixed with a vitamin (which is what they taste like).

So to save money, do what endurance athletes have been doing for more than half a century: eat small amounts of pure dextrose/glucose without mixing with fat or protein during a prolonged effort. Combined with a sugar-free electrolyte drink and you can control the amount of fuel in your tank without affecting your hydration.

I've found gummy bears to not digest as nicely (probably because of the 2 grams of protein from the gelatin). Same goes for any candy with fat in it.

Sweet Tarts and Bottlecaps are therefore my favorite direct-to-muscles simple carb source. Plus they taste good, are easy to carry, and can be micro-portioned very easily on a ride in order to not overdo it.

It's absolutely stupid to pay crazy amounts of money for "healthy" and "recovery" and "fitness" variations of the same thing. In fact, eating a few combined with a bottle of my cheap protein powder, and another another with my zero calorie electrolyte hydration mix and I save the money I would have spent on exactly the same ingredients in Tailwind "recovery mix" which costs (and I'm not kidding) 10 times more money.
