# Eggs excellent source of vitamins D, B12, etc.

Eggs are a legitimate wonder food (when eaten boiled and not fried or combined with anything else). Not only do they have tons of protein, but they provide D and B12 which most humans are woefully deficient. They are by far the best (and most sustainable) form of natural protein on the planet. Athletes have known this for years, and the science is there to back it up.

By the way, *you cannot gain cholesterol by ingesting cholesterol*. It is one of the most prevalent lies out there. (See Peter Attia's Outlive Chapter 6 on heart disease for details.)
