# Kubernetes is not a top priority in 2023

Although Kubernetes is definitely a priority in 2023, it won't be the *top* priority. This is because my work requires more of my Go expertise than anything else since I'm one of only two on the team that can code in it and the top team priority for 2023 is delivering a kick-ass enterprise REST API into our HPC ML systems and processes. I'll still tinker with Kubernetes and do stuff for testing our REST deployment (which uses Kubernetes) but only in the service of the more important platform engineering work I need to do.
