# Why don't you split your TMUX panes?

Because at the [font size] and [display] resolution that I use it
doesn't make any sense. Besides, switching full windows is a lot easier
to manage and visualize by looking in the menu bar. It's also nice that
this approach is fully supported in `screen` and often a system will
only have `screen` so having my fingers know what to do is nice. (My
[TMUX config] is set to feel like `screen` for that reason).
