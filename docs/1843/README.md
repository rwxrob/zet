# The YAML "Norway" Problem

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/mIcdYkKu1CE>

* Yes it's annoying, but easy to work around
* YAML is for humans, and there's nothing better
* Dealing with large amounts of text or nesting
* Everybody knows YAML learn
* YAML has the merge operator and linking, others don't
* What kind of crazy person doesn't put a v in front of semver?
* Just stop using semicolons in JavaScript as well
