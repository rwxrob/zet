# Weekday routine

Having a daily routine has always taken me from someplace I was to someplace I want to be. Routine provides safety and efficiency and is the reason the military and so many organizations use it as a foundational training principle.

* Wake up and turn on the yoga room space heater
* Drink coffee and do something with my best brain
* Use the restroom
* Do modified half-primary Ashtanga (40 minutes, strength/flexibility)
* Drink a full liter of water
* Eat two eggs (soft or hard boiled)
* Do any cleaning and light chores required for the day
* Get to where I'm going to work for the day (with laptop)
* Work until about 3pm taking lunch and breaks regularly
* Drink some coffee and take a 30 minute nap (not longer)
* Ride my bike ride in zone 2 for 2-4 hours (water only, livestream)
* Drink a green/fruit smoothie after ride (all micronutrients)
* Relax and do something personal on the computer
* Eat a big, healthy dinner with family and talk about our day
* Take a multi-vitamin after dinner
* Watch something on the TV with my wife and dog and snuggle (popcorn)
* Go to bed relatively early to allow making best use of next morning
