I spend a lot of time writing and talking about the different type of live streaming and other content like this [2024 main formats and categories of livestreaming content](../2686) but the reason is because all this shit is going to directly affect what code I write on stream. I've been wanting to write an assistant that allows me to just type one word or tap a button and change all the stuff on the stream so that the rest can be automated.

I need to install Harbor and flatten the chart. I wonder if I should just break down and install Docker instead of Podman. I'm souring on Podman lately. It is starting to break in really strange ways and the lack of a socket makes integrating with a host a lot harder (which is what makes Docker more likely to get owned by hackers, but yeah).

I need to update my `keg` release to v0.9.2 as well and migrate to `goreleaser` for everything.

Can't forget appointment to look at new 10x15 storage unit in Davidson tomorrow. It's walking distance from my apartment and got permission to do all kinds of bike maintenance and stuff in it. It's privately owned and Ellen (the manager) is amazing. So I finally have a place to get messy and build out my IRL bike kit and maintain it while still streaming everything. I can launch all my biggest trips from that location, I've even thought of keeping my main adventure bike rig (Keshy) there and using my towny (who is now gonna need a name) to get from the apartment to the unit. That way I can leave Keshy all geared up and not have to break her down and unpack her every time I ride her. Hell, my towny might even be better for rides on the trail.
