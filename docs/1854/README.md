# ðŸ“ž How does KEG compare to Wikipedia?

KEG is more like if Twitter and Wikipedia "had a baby" (as mossy_machines) put it. KEG fundamentally is only a specification for how to organize content in a sustainable, exchangeable way, nothing more. There are, however, a number of significant differences:

* Wikipedia promotes antagonistic editing practices
* Wikipedia never has a single voice making it hard to read
* Wikipedia is regularly inaccurate and controlled by trolls
* Wikipedia has no criteria for who is an author
* Wikipedia is a centralized, non-profit service that begs for money

And as for KEG:

* KEG promotes community policing and trust building
* KEG promotes a single editorial voice and theme per KEG
* KEG content is decentralized and can be aggregated any number of ways
* KEG has no financial concerns since it is simply an open specification
* KEG motivates quality content to get on FOLLOW and not AVOID lists
* KEG content can be signed by the creator ensuring authenticity
* KEG services are always catering to the users and creators
