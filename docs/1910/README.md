# ðŸ§˜Yoga Log

***Monday, January 2, 2023, 2:52:12PM EST***

Second day in 2023 and feels amazing. This doing yoga in front of people is freaking me out a bit, but I'll get over it. It's kind of good training for non-attachment. If I can continuously get my fat ass on stream doing yoga and be okay with all of it I will have mastered one of the most important parts of yoga. Besides, if even a single person starts their own yoga practice because of my public suffering and failures then the world will be that much better off. It's fucking worth it. I'm just a crusty old man trying to improve his healthy. Cringe be damned.

I almost made it through half-primary today. The sloppiest shit ever, but I fucking showed up. Just showing up is more than half the battle. I have to keep listening to my heart rate because I'm definitely pushing it. Don't want to have a coronary on stream (although that would be great for views, as if I gave a shit about that). I noticed last year that I pushed myself too hard with yoga and had to pull back which eventually meant I stopped, not this fucking year, no fucking way, if all I do is casually try to hit the poses imma keep doing it no matter what! There's too much at stake, most of all my sanity in what is about to be one *fucking crazy* world (2024 will be presidential elections). As members of my stream reminded me, "be the change you want to be, in the world".

I had three beers after yoga and got very nostalgic and weepy again (even before the beers). Crazy how yoga does that to me every time. There's gotta be a scientific reason associated with it.

I created a zet for the Ashtanga limbs and studied their meaning again. I want to start reflecting on theme every time I do a log just to keep myself in a good place.

Time might be off, forgot to log it back then. I had a burrito and beer from the local gas station while live streaming before I did yoga and was surprised it didn't affect me more. Felt so amazing afterward. I didn't make it through more than like 20 minutes. I think just getting the Sun As and Bs in was a huge win given that I haven't done any fucking yoga for more than a year. I'm gonna come back.
