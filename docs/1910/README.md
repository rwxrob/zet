# ðŸ§˜Yoga Log

***Tuesday, January 3, 2023, 9:19:37PM EST***

This morning the sky was orange out the window when I woke so I walked to a field and meditated for a bit. I took the Twitch community along with me for the ride. It was a very nice sunrise. I'm going to try and do that every morning. Just such a great way to start the day. Worth the time spent.

Today's yoga was *tough*! My body doesn't recover like it once did. The load from the last two days has caught up with me. I made it through about 30 minutes, but after the sun salutations I was toast. I did some version of most of the half-primary poses, but even that was hard. I really don't want to blow all this momentum by pushing too hard. I have to remember Ahimsa.

I did practice some *great* Bhakti yoga at sunset. The overcast skies kept the sun from shining through, so we met Jose, the owner of a local restaurant and my neighbor, it turns out. I had an amazing enchilada dinner, a couple beers, and some great conversation with my neighbor, his brother Carlos, and co-worker Mula. The community was really welcoming. I was smiling ear to ear not wanting it to stop. But, just so exhausted.

Second day in 2023 and feels amazing. This doing yoga in front of people is freaking me out a bit, but I'll get over it. It's kind of good training for non-attachment. If I can continuously get my fat ass on stream doing yoga and be okay with all of it I will have mastered one of the most important parts of yoga. Besides, if even a single person starts their own yoga practice because of my public suffering and failures then the world will be that much better off. It's fucking worth it. I'm just a crusty old man trying to improve his healthy. Cringe be damned.

I almost made it through half-primary today. The sloppiest shit ever, but I fucking showed up. Just showing up is more than half the battle. I have to keep listening to my heart rate because I'm definitely pushing it. Don't want to have a coronary on stream (although that would be great for views, as if I gave a shit about that). I noticed last year that I pushed myself too hard with yoga and had to pull back which eventually meant I stopped, not this fucking year, no fucking way, if all I do is casually try to hit the poses imma keep doing it no matter what! There's too much at stake, most of all my sanity in what is about to be one *fucking crazy* world (2024 will be presidential elections). As members of my stream reminded me, "be the change you want to be, in the world".

I had three beers after yoga and got very nostalgic and weepy again (even before the beers). Crazy how yoga does that to me every time. There's gotta be a scientific reason associated with it.

I created a zet for the Ashtanga limbs and studied their meaning again. I want to start reflecting on theme every time I do a log just to keep myself in a good place.

Time might be off, forgot to log it back then. I had a burrito and beer from the local gas station while live streaming before I did yoga and was surprised it didn't affect me more. Felt so amazing afterward. I didn't make it through more than like 20 minutes. I think just getting the Sun As and Bs in was a huge win given that I haven't done any fucking yoga for more than a year. I'm gonna come back.
