# ðŸ§˜Yoga Log

Today was a disaster. My health is completely crashing. I've definitely over-trained. I fucking hate being 55 (with regard to my health). I have to take it slower, but I'm not going to stop, damn it!

Yesterday I did only one sun A. But I biked a ton the day before, which was my "yoga" for that day. Could hardly walk after. It was glorious.

Yoga today was pretty fun. I left the TTS on and was able to hear the comments coming in from the stream. Doris was cooking in the other room and we chatted while I did yoga. We had our old playlist from when we were on our honeymoon in Asheville. She even mentioned it reminder her of when she would make salsa while I did yoga in the other room. The music makes all the difference for me. In fact, I know I'm suppose to be all focused and concentrating on the breath, but fuck it. I want to have fun. I prefer the rave-party-yoga vibe with really fun music on while I go through the poses. For some reason it helps me not take it so seriously. I get all serious when I do yoga and sometimes even get more stressed out because I can't hit poses. I know in my mind that this is totally not the way to be, but it's a struggle. The music gives me something to focus on and remember that it's all just fun. It's all good. Then, when my wife says something, or teases me, or interrupts me I don't bark at her. I smile instead.

Woah, has it really been a week since I last wrote in the log? That explains a lot. Feeling a lot stronger, but today I had a sudden intense headache. Kinda scared the shit out of me. I mean, I don't think I'm a stroke candidate, but I am 55. I can think of fewer things in life that I would want to endure than losing all my mobility and mental acuity just to become someone's ward to take care of for the rest of their lives. I'm gonna schedule a physical. They say you should "get a physical before doing anything intense" and I do pretty intense yoga, and it has been something like a half a year since I did anything physical at all. If nothing else, need to get the BP checked. Someone made a joke about "big dick energy" but I tell you want, this feels like the opposite of that. But, imma own this one way or another.

Better. Maybe it's the sun outside. Maybe it's not having my wife "assist" me. ;) Managed a back-bend today, not pretty, but strength coming back to do them. Biggest challenge now is my fucking fat in the way.

Oh, I had my "race" meal an hour before and it totally worked. It's almost like my body has dialed into it over the decades:

* Half a banana
* Almost burnt piece of toast
* Half-tablespoon of peanut butter
* Full glass of water.

Best PRs of my life came after that meal. So weird that there isn't much to it.

Tomorrow is a full moon day. Day after that is Saturday. So, I'll do some Saucha tomorrow. Saturday, will be doing Bhakti by helping others get a practice started if they want one. I'm still the king of cringe, but what the hell, if even a single person starts a personal practice because of my fat ass it will have been worth it.

Wife talked my ear off during all of it. Which was probably good because I was absolutely wiped out. I think it might be a moon day that I just don't know. I feel the "tide" is out. I did manage a headstand today though. Wife gave me a Shavasana assist that was glorious.

This morning the sky was orange out the window when I woke so I walked to a field and meditated for a bit. I took the Twitch community along with me for the ride. It was a very nice sunrise. I'm going to try and do that every morning. Just such a great way to start the day. Worth the time spent.

Today's yoga was *tough*! My body doesn't recover like it once did. The load from the last two days has caught up with me. I made it through about 30 minutes, but after the sun salutations I was toast. I did some version of most of the half-primary poses, but even that was hard. I really don't want to blow all this momentum by pushing too hard. I have to remember Ahimsa.

I did practice some *great* Bhakti yoga at sunset. The overcast skies kept the sun from shining through, so we met Jose, the owner of a local restaurant and my neighbor, it turns out. I had an amazing enchilada dinner, a couple beers, and some great conversation with my neighbor, his brother Carlos, and co-worker Mula. The community was really welcoming. I was smiling ear to ear not wanting it to stop. But, just so exhausted.

Second day in 2023 and feels amazing. This doing yoga in front of people is freaking me out a bit, but I'll get over it. It's kind of good training for non-attachment. If I can continuously get my fat ass on stream doing yoga and be okay with all of it I will have mastered one of the most important parts of yoga. Besides, if even a single person starts their own yoga practice because of my public suffering and failures then the world will be that much better off. It's fucking worth it. I'm just a crusty old man trying to improve his healthy. Cringe be damned.

I almost made it through half-primary today. The sloppiest shit ever, but I fucking showed up. Just showing up is more than half the battle. I have to keep listening to my heart rate because I'm definitely pushing it. Don't want to have a coronary on stream (although that would be great for views, as if I gave a shit about that). I noticed last year that I pushed myself too hard with yoga and had to pull back which eventually meant I stopped, not this fucking year, no fucking way, if all I do is casually try to hit the poses imma keep doing it no matter what! There's too much at stake, most of all my sanity in what is about to be one *fucking crazy* world (2024 will be presidential elections). As members of my stream reminded me, "be the change you want to be, in the world".

I had three beers after yoga and got very nostalgic and weepy again (even before the beers). Crazy how yoga does that to me every time. There's gotta be a scientific reason associated with it.

I created a zet for the Ashtanga limbs and studied their meaning again. I want to start reflecting on theme every time I do a log just to keep myself in a good place.

Time might be off, forgot to log it back then. I had a burrito and beer from the local gas station while live streaming before I did yoga and was surprised it didn't affect me more. Felt so amazing afterward. I didn't make it through more than like 20 minutes. I think just getting the Sun As and Bs in was a huge win given that I haven't done any fucking yoga for more than a year. I'm gonna come back.
