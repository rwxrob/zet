# ðŸ§˜Yoga Log

Second day in 2023 and feels amazing. This doing yoga in front of people is freaking me out a bit, but I'll get over it. It's kind of good training for non-attachment. If I can continuously get my fat ass on stream doing yoga and be okay with all of it I will have mastered one of the most important parts of yoga. Besides, if even a single person starts their own yoga practice because of my public suffering and failures then the world will be that much better off. It's fucking worth it. I'm just a crusty old man trying to improve his healthy. Cringe be damned.

I almost made it through half-primary today. The sloppiest shit ever, but I fucking showed up. Just showing up is more than half the battle.
