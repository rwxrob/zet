# Rediscovering Solarized Dark theme

I was pleasantly surprised by how beautiful Solarized Dark was after reinstalling iTerm2 and noticing it was one of the included ones that didn't have to have Gruvbox installed. Then I installed Gruvbox and found myself missing the colorful nature of Solarized Dark. Anything to improve my mood porting all this Python to Go code at work.
