# Leave camera mounted to bike when touring

The question about where to put the camera when livestreaming bike touring isn't an easy one to answer. Some mount the camera on a boom including the biker with the scenery from the rear perspective. Some wear a cam mounted on their helmet. Some wear a chest mount. Plus the wide angle question constantly changes all of that as well. The decision about how to manage and position the camera comes down to the following:

* How much time is the rider going to spend in the saddle?
* What are the possible positions of the rider in the saddle?
* What is most comfortable for the rider?
* What is most aesthetically pleasing for viewer?
* What is the risk to the gear from weather and vibration?
* How complex is the setup to start and maintain?

Based on these criteria, I personally think that mounting the camera to a make-shift cross-bar connecting my carbon aero-bars in the far front is best. I also think the Pocket 3 is the best general camera for this because it can be easily panned and flipped to show the landscape or back at me while talking to the viewers from an upright sitting position. I can also pan it to the left or right to see what is happening on the sides of the road. The Orange Pi(s), battery bricks, and fans go in my Velcro quick-release trunk bag with shoulder strap so that I can walk around it with it on occasion (although I've decided to generally leave the camera mounted and not fidget with it as much as possible).

Speaking of leaving the camera with the bike, when I go into a store quickly to pick up food and supplies the livestreaming camera acts as an addition security measure as well---especially if I take my phone with me. I can literally see what is happening in addition to any deterrent and tracker that I might add to the bike. I also have recorded footage of any attempt to do anything to the bike. This is another easy to mount the camera as far forward as possible so that I can get the entire bike and all the gear in the shot while I'm away.

Since the Pocket 3 is extremely fragile in any sort of water condition---especially the gimble motor (which I know from personal experience)---I'm taking two Action 4s as well which can be well-taped to prevent any weather situation from ruining it during even the hardest downpours.
