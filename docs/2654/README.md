# DNB "credit-card touring" gear list

This gear list is for living a luxurious "credit card" digital nomad life, paying for pretty much everything (the opposite of roughing it) including a place to stay every night that has power, water, shelter, and usually a warm shower. An ultra-light sleeping bag, pillow, and pad are including for naps and hostels and places without bedding, but only an emergency bivy is required for shelter, if that. No tents. The chair takes the work out of finding good rest stops. Most meals are eaten on the road meaning no big cook kit or food storage is needed beyond one or two no-cook meals or snacks. The minimal stove that is included is mostly for luxurious coffee or ramen breaks anywhere (which is particularly nice during colder tours). Water is expected to be plentiful so no more than a liter carrying capacity is needed with the emergency capability to carry and filter three additional liters. The ultra-light backpack allows for carrying additional items in those exceptional times as well as transporting groceries to the hotel for the next day.

Note that this gear list mixes "smellies" and therefore is unsuitable for any touring through potential critter/bear country where isolating them is impossible.
