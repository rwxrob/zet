# Simplifying Twitch streaming schedule

I go through it every year, I put to much on the schedule and then I pull it all off again. This time I've made a few conclusions about why this happens and what I want to prioritize.

***Zwift category is my new home.*** Zwift is something I want to make a part of my personal identity and Twitch persona for the rest of my life. This means daily Zwift streams and meeting all the amazing people in the super tiny Zwift Twitch category. These are humans that I really want to get to know and maintain friendships with for a very long time (even more than those I've met in the other categories, as amazing as the people are). Many of the Zwifters are also techies, many of whom didn't even know about Twitch tech categories when they came to Zwift via Twitch.

***Maintain Science & Technology career streams.*** The category that started it all for me is still the best career category. It covers everything from hacking, to robotics, to biochemistry, and infrastructure engineering. It's a small, quaint community that I do so love. I'm going to commit to one 2-3 hour stream on the schedule in this category once a week. Part of the year will be Linux Boost related, and another part will be Linux Homelab init related.

***Occasional Coding streams.*** I refuse to write the stupid "Software and Game Development" category title. I'm always hated the "what game are you working on?" title. In fact, I really have no love for the entire category itself. Very rarely is anyone doing anything in there that I'm actually interested in. Why watch a bunch of mediocre people live streaming bad or irrelevant coding when you could read the actual code written by top contributors to FOSS projects on GitHub and elsewhere? I understand that people want to watch coders who are just learning, but for me, there has never been a single thing I've learned or wanted to watch having sampled hundreds of hours of Twitch coding. The *people* in this category are great people, just not doing anything I care about, usually. But, when I do decide to write some code publicly, I'll set this to the category and try to take regular breaks to explain what I'm coding (without breaking my train of thought). However, this is *always* secondary to the scheduled **Science and Tech** streams that are specifically designed to be of value to those who are watching.

***IRL when the moment feels right.*** I've been IRL streaming everything, and after the \$475 bill from ATT for "overages" (despite the lies from the sales guy that I would never be charged for overages, only throttled). I have to pull way back on IRL. In fact, I have about 8 hours a week total. This means that I'm going to be much more picky about my IRL content. Most of my IRL content will be me biking in different planned destinations all over the Lake Norman and Charlotte area. I'll do some cooking and at-home stuff that doesn't take away from my bandwidth, but I'll never know when that will be in advance. Wearing my streaming rig slows me down during the day when doing chores and stuff and I'd just as well finish them quickly and focus on streaming other stuff, like the occasional, beautiful sunset (just not every night).

***Guitar playing in Music category.*** Eventually, when health gets back and I settle down a bit after the move I do want to add a regular day for just playing guitar and working on people's requests. I don't think I will do the practice on stream as I have done in the past, which will mean playing my limited number of songs in my song list until I build it up again.
