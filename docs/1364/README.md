# Typing Speed is Far Less Important Than Thought

In technology it is far more important to increase the speed of thought
and research than typing speed. Busting through the `vimtutor` program
in lightning time or any other typing game might be incredibly fun and
rewarding but is is absolutely meaningless when considering producing
actually value. 

Knowledge acquisition, processing, and sharing is so much more important
that I'm practically not even going to mention typing speed any longer
in my boosts. You can bust out whatever the fuck in your favorite coding
language but if it takes you an extra 10 minutes to find answers to
things because you use a graphic browser for everything and have no
fucking idea how to search from the command line then all your gains are
for shit. People don't like hearing that, but its so true. The same
people are more likely to spend more time spinning their wheels on
things that they have to redo later than to think through the issue and
research it in a way that saves 10x that work later. Twitch and YouTube
are *full* of people with the wrong priorities and a bunch of other
people who don't know better are trying to emulate this stuff. If
calling this shit out makes me unpopular so be it. Those who actually
matter in the industry understand this and will reward those who put in
the time to realize these priorities for themselves.
