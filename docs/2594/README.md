The trip to Utah to visit family has been delayed. There are just too many critical things unresolved right now:

* Waiting on official driver's license
* Insurance claim paperwork
* New hire insurance and other on-boarding administrative stuff
* Returning mistaken laptop sent as if I was new hire
* Signed new apartment lease
* Starlink third-party gear broke
* Intensely raining season delayed storage unit prep
* Ants have moved into storage unit
* Water test of some bike gear massively failed

I've taken the entire week off of work hoping to resolve all of this and be able to still get on the road but if I'm not able I'll just leave anyway next week despite working along the way and only travel when not working. The good news is that Starlink is rock solid on my car so I can work from anywhere along the way and I have full access to all communication methods for work through my phone so I can even drive during some of the meetings.
