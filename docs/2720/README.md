# `homelab init`: researching options

1. collect your own hardware
2. use cloud for everything
3. simulate hardware with virtualisation
4. simulate hardware with containerization

My personal requirements:

* Be able to emulate Kubernetes from scratch prod, dev, inf clusters
* Be able to test backend enterprise API development
* Be able to run OpenPBS
* Be able to emulate our Ansible cluster deployment automations
* Integrate with GitHub Actions with "custom runner"
* Only simulated systems are required
* I do not need a lot of GPU capacity in cluster or batch

Questions:

* Is my laptop good enough?
* What are my requirements?
* Do I need to emulate ML model jobs at home? In k8s? In batch?
