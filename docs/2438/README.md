# Best binaural cycling mic setup for the money

I love ASMR outdoor cycling vidoes. I like watching them and making them. They give me something more interesting to watch on the days when it is raining outside. So creating the most realistic experience (without distractions) was a priority to me setting out to make the best 4K binaural outdoor cycling vidoes possible (while also getting a ride in).

Rode Go Pro (not the II) wireless has by far the best sound quality in my opinion having watching tons of comparison videos. It also has many other serious advantages over DJI mic and is the only 32 bit recording option. It's better than the Hollyland because noise cancellation is the opposite of what is wanted. The Hollyland is great, however, when doing binaural at a concert or something. But with 32bit recording on Rode even then I rarely if ever will use it. It also deals with vibrations way better than other options like any of the Zoom mics or Sonic Presence stuff. Again, the 32 bit recording makes these other options seem silly in comparison.

I attach to the top of my Action 4 using the following:

* [SmallRig Cage](https://amzn.to/45Tlm77)
* [Movo shock mount](https://amzn.to/3QGjZnR)
* [Double microphone mount](https://amzn.to/3tZbZWk)
* [Handle bar mount](https://amzn.to/40nHipP)

I use the 1/4" screw to attach the SmallRig case to the handle bar mount for stability. It isn't that hard to unscrew it and when I want portability I'll just loosen it, remove the entire ball attachment, and then transfer to selfie stick with Action mag mount on it.

I take off the screws of the microphone mount and attach all the Rode components with double-sided velcro and secure with a black rubber band. This keeps the weight way less and avoids too much movement. It does make it tougher to put the mics back in their case, but I rarely do that just leaving in their binaural configuration.

* Rode is better than DJI
