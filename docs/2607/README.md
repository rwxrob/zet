# Tactical-ize your battery bricks and power station

Tactical vests have velcro all over them allowing different things to be quickly attached and reconfigured. It might not be the first thing a person would think of, but that big-ol battery power station a DNB lugs around is a perfect target for tacticalization (which is a word I think I just invented). By simply covering the top with the fuzzy part of Velcro (hook-n-loop) stuff a piece of hook tape can be put on anything to easily ensure stuff set on top of the power station doesn't move around. Considering how smooth and slippery most battery banks are, this dramatically improves the speed of the daily logistics required to stay powered up when carrying that thing into someplace for charging, or moving it once an outlet becomes available. The alternative (which I've experienced personally) is attempting to move it and having everything slide off making a loud noise drawing even more attention to my wierdness). On my Jackery Explorer Pro 1000 I have enough room to attach a 370 watt USB charger and three large Baseus 60000 mAp batter bricks. Once attached they look like they belong there. If you have something covering the battery while in the trailer you don't even have to detach them until they are being used. I put an elasticized backpack rain cover over the top of the whole thing including the non-taped open ports in case of sudden, random rain that I could not have predicted.
