ðŸ’¢ I really hate Rust: the syntax is uglier than Java; it takes *forever* to write anything in it; compilation times are ridiculous; the mod team resigned in disgust because of "hypocrisy" of the governance board; Ph.Ds have written dissertations on how Rust "safety" is a lie; and there are virtually *no* jobs for Rust. !Go blows Rust away for the things which matter most.

Let me tell you a story of the first person who ever told me about Rust.

A person who paid me to mentor them was *hugely* into Rust (mostly because of the active, vibrant, enthusiastic community, at least, the ones who didn't resign in disgust over the hypocrisy of the steering committee). This person had received a psychology degree but could not find a job. That's why they started paying me to help them.

I was open with them about it and let them make their own decisions, as always.

One day they said, "Ya know, I really need to learn Go to get a job. There are zero Rust jobs."

I agreed, but this person had to come to this realization the their own, which was hard.

They learned Go and almost immediately got a job making 100K American dollars a year starting salary specifically because of learning Go, and then they also got to work on Rust there.

Most people learning a language are doing so to become productive and employable, like my friend. Rust distracts you from these goals.

While it is an exciting language for a very specific niche of applications that are yet to be determined, it is a huge fucking waste of time for MOST people reading this.

Like my friend, do yourself (and your family) a favor and master Linux, bash, python, Go, and even JavaScript before even wading into Rust. Then you can waste your time learning Rust if you really want. I don't. I have more productive things to waste it on, like Dota2 or Overwatch.

And, please, for the love of God, learn enough C to understand what all the Rust hype about "garbage collection" and memory management and dangling pointers is even about. Otherwise, you just sound like a sheeple idiot trying to justify your decision to learn Rust first without knowing a damn thing about how software actually works.

***Rust is good for some things.*** Web development is not one of those things. Writing a OS security vulnerability fuzzer? Yes. Want to write device drivers in something besides C? Yes. Want to write a layer between Linux kernel and Java Android API? Yes. Most people, however, absolutely, positively will *never* need to write this kind of software. I prefer languages that empower the most people, not a select few engineers who actually enjoy the shittiest syntax ever conceived and for some reason don't give a shit about compilation times, like, *at all*.
