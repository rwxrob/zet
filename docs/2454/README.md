# Recipe: fresh salsa

* 3-4 Roma tomatoes (or equivalent in size)
* 2-3 green onions (keep as much of green as possible)
* 1 full bell pepper
* 1 handful cilantro
* 1 lime with pulp (reamed)
* salt to taste

Put it all into a [salsa maker](https://amzn.to/46al9MX) and chop it up but don't over do it our you will get foamy salsa instead of what you want.

You can add Serrano or Jalapeno peppers as well if you like it hotter. My wife likes it with garlic as well.
