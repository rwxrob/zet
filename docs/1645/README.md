# Twitch Promotes Gamified Community Involvement

The reason Twitch will continue to dominate over YouTube is the same
reason that I was initially annoyed by it: Twitch promotes gamified
community building. Just the community aspect alone is amazing, but
making fun to engage and get to know and even compete with other
community members really solidifies deep involvement and interaction.
