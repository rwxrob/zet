# Bike across America trip is back on?

Not sure why I started looking into it again. Perhaps it was the fact that I'm biking 200-300 miles a week these days already, or the routes that stay away from major highways that are available, or the fact that it has been a life-long dream/goal of mine and I'm not getting any younger. I'm in the best cycling shape I've been in for the last 20 years and I feel like I would be letting an opportunity go to waste. The question is, how do I make it a reality.

## Money

The obvious biggest question is how the hell am I going to finance it. With my wife having a solid job, and me having a *really* good job that allows me to take extended time periods off, and the live stream community being there to help me out over time, I think I have a good shot at hitting my financial goals there. The challenge will be getting in enough interesting "content" while still hitting the time goals so that I come in on budget.

* Minimum 12k saved up (4k/month) to support family/streaming
* 3000 dollars (about 44 dollars per day) food/lodging
* 600 airfare to Portland with gear
* 200 gas to come pick me up from Washington, DC (or flight home)

Looking at these numbers makes me sick to my stomach. The actual cost of the trip is pretty minimal. It's the *lost* money from not working that is astounding (and those numbers are less than what I would actually be losing by not working).

I can't help feel that by taking my car and just going to different destinations *and still working from that location* and biking for four hours around that location is far better use of my time.

I don't have to sweat the details now. Perhaps just "manifesting" it is enough. Maybe my wife will hit it big after her art gallery show and subsequent shows in New York and Austria. There is one possible future where taking 12k of loss per year is nothing. If and when that becomes true I'll be ready to go. The motivation to increase the daily mileage and get my bike in order still apply. I never want to be *not* ready to go when the chance comes up.
