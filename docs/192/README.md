# "Poor Men Zettelkasten with Go"

Thanks to lousenti for sharing this project he stumbled upon. I know of
another one on GitLab as well. I'm so glad people are finding their own
way and realizing they can take control of creating their own `zet`
applications rather than depending on a proprietary one that requires
their lock-in. If there is one project worth everyone's time, it's
creating a system for managing one's own knowledge, in one's own way
(and so much better than a fucking Discord bot).
