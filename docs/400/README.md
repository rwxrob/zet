# Dirty Little KVM Secret

This fancy \$300 KVM switch from StarTech does its thing and all but
takes a ridiculously long time to switch between monitors while waiting
for the computer to re-detect the "new" monitor. That's absolute
bullshit. The whole point of the KVM is to keep the connection cached so
that there is no display initialization taking place when switching.
Apparently, such is not the case. The long and sort of it is that it is
just fucking stupid to buy a K*V*M when a KM is just fine. Switching the
USB is all you *really* need anyway. I'm sure I could have saved
hundreds of dollars if I had realized this earlier.

I don't trust the buttons to last on the monitor to make the switch that
way all the time. So the best option of all, of course, is to have
multiple monitors on at the same time. I'll have to rethink how I have
them on my desk. I once though having one on top of the other was the
best, but I now realize that would make my neck hurt real fast. So
side-by-side it is. It will fuck up my speakers, lighting, and camera,
but I'll figure it out.
