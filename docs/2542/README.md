# Sunday is for books

I really enjoyed last Sunday. Now that I'm averaging 2-3 hours on a bike every day having a solid day completely off to do something that has nothing to do with cycling is refreshing. That's already the day I doing the Beginner Boost. But, I've found that taking the night to work on book projects quietly and stay in a good mental place is very rewarding. As I work out the details of how to write the best ePub I can using my favorite tools I find ideas popping into my head for different smaller books that would be worth creating, even some fiction:

* Authentic Influence: Lessons Learned from an Live-Streaming Boomer
* There and Never Back Again (#nevermormon)
* Finding Love that Lasts
