# Kubernetes Applications Development (CKAD) Colearning

üì∫ <https://youtu.be/w9IpcnBhjiQ>

1. Seems like there are two approaches to CKAD
    1. Understand concepts and patterns for applications development
    1. Install and configure existing application
    1. Create and deploy new applications
       * "init, sidecar, app, load-balancing, database + pv"
1. Pick a project for each
    * Deploy ElasticSearch (ECK stack)
    * Deploy Istio
    * Build an online / live community (not as related)
    * (Note that rwxrob.tv schedule will have specifics)
1. What Kubernetes platform on which to build?
    * Prioritizing an authentic experience for *true* learning
    * Minikube
      * "Doesn't have good PV emulation or support" (black_mou5e)
    * Kind
      * The darling of the Cluster API world
      * Built specifically to do Kubernetes development and testing
    * Cloud
      * Expensive to get all the nodes to model complex deployment
    * k3s / microk8s
      * Not a full Kubernetes implementation
      * Specifically designed for small-scale IoT/Edge implementations
    * Hardware
      * Obviously the best, just takes a lot of infra work to setup
      * No yet ready
      * Building out IRL on stream starting next week
