# rwxrob.tv: !rat !ratx !ratex

🐀Ratex (`rat/x`) is a language implemented entirely with compilable Go types using Go's type switch capability for compilation into a grammar/pattern/expression that can then be used to check/scan/parse any Unicode data. Ratex is essentially a Go representation of !PEGN.
