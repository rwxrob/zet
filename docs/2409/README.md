# Staying connected as digital nomad

When working on the remote places from my car I can't be offline, not even for 10 minutes. All my research suggests the minimum anyone should have is one boosted mobile signal and a wireless wifi router hotspot (like the Netgear Nighthawk M6) and a Starlink Mobile Priority plan. Most will also have a second hotspot from another service provider.
