# 100 is the new 72 (maximum terminal columns to assume)

It's 2023. I've been fighting this for a while, mostly because I was streaming and needed the space on the sides, but that was silly. People have at least 100 columns now. In the case of Markdown, people should not be wrapping at all so that the width is adjusted automatically. And code all over GitHub regularly uses 100 column wrapping. This is really essential when you are dealing with really stupid naming conventions that some use.

This means that the KEG title will be 98 (100 minus 2 for the `#` and single space).
