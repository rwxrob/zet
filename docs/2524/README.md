# Endurance athletes over 50 or 60

Here's the realities I've gleaned from the pros and my own experience over the last two years of getting back into endurance sports. I'm 56 now:

* VO2 max is one of greatest indicators of longevity
* Over 50 people lose training gains faster than younger people (so don't stop)
* Over 50 people lose VO2 max very quickly
* Over 50 people lose all muscle gains after only six weeks
* Over 50 people put on fat about 30% faster than younger people
* Over 50 people must continue to "include intensity" in exercise
* Over 50 people benefit more from high-intensity more than ultra endurance
* Over 50 people should not fear high-intensity, it helps, not hurts

Hearing Nathan and Joel talk in these videos has me adjusting my training priorities:

* Focus on shorter, intense races and events to promote VO2 max and strength
* Main annual event: 120 km (75 miles) Lake Norman Gran Fondo in three hours
* Build an old-man "sprinter" body to counter-act loss of muscle
* Focus on high-intensity Zwift indoor racing above all else
* Reach 4.0 w/kg FTP by 2025 (300 watts / 75 kilos)
* 20 minutes of fasted yoga first thing every day (as physical therapy)
* 21-day training cycle (TRRTRRTRR TRRTRRTRR RRR) for best recovery
* 30,000 TSS annual training volume (about 1764/cycle, 800/9-days)
* Sleep 8-12 hours a day depending on recovery needs including nap
* Two 150+ TSS days include HiT strength/power or racing (usually safely indoors)
* One 150+ TSS day with 4-7 hour endurance ride (preferably outdoors)
* All recovery days no more than 50 TSS (usually 2 hours zone 1 outdoors around sunset)
* Must include strength training during "race" season (unlike my youth)
* Must eliminate calorie-dense and processed foods but eat as much good food as want
* Absolutely no main events longer than three hours
* No more Assault on Mt. Mitchell after 2024 (too long and slow)
* No Tour Divide / GDMBR or other "ultra endurance" stuff
* One very slow bikepacking trip every 21 days during RRR just for fun
