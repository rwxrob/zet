# Be Careful of Packt Publishing

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/Hu6r1AXJ7IE>

* Flatter as many techies with basic writing skills as we can
* Get them to write books as fast as possible
* Skip the time-wasting editors in the process
* Beat other (edited) publications to print
* Kind-of like the sleazy recruiters from LinkedIn but for authors
* Occasionally something good comes from an author (not Packt)
* Prefer more established publishers (who actually have editors)...
* Addison-Wesley, O'Reilly, No-Starch Press, etc.
* I have a problem with books in general ...
* Books get out of date quickly
* Follow people, not books and publishers
