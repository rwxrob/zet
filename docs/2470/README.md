# Bike to Spartanburg and back between Xmas and New Years

December 29 and 30 are open and I am not working those days. Wife's show opening is Thursday the 28th. I'm only going to plan the route, not the lodging. I want to practice being okay with randomness and adapting on the fly. I'll take stuff to sleep outside if possible and prefer that but won't rule out a hotel if needed.
