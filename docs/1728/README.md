# Microblogging is a horrible format for good communications

***You cannot compose a full thought.*** Microblogging format punishes those who use more than 100 characters even if allowed to write that much.

***You cannot dialog.*** There is no real-time interaction.

***You are plagued with "me too".*** Everyone agreeing becomes a burden to slog through. Better to read the well-thought responses than just the thumbs-up posts.

***You are rewarded for conclusions without explanation.*** Not only is there no room to present all your reasoning, people are bored by it. Instead, you get grandiose, baiting proclamations like "Rust is the future" only to be left why you wasted your time even reading that thread in the first place with no substantiation for the claim. This is one place academic writing, as boring and annoying as it is to create, wins on merit because making *any* conclusion without multiple citations and references is strongly frowned upon, not rewarded.

***You have constant FOMO.*** There is no way to keep up with all the blogging so you never feel like you have had time to consume even those you feel are worth following. It is far more valuable to isolate your interactions to a few subject matter experts who take the time to compose their thoughts well and dismiss the FOMO completely. Sure lots of people will have micro-thoughts to go with their micro-blogs, but they are of micro-significance. This is one fact I've been smacked over the head with over and over. All that time wasted reading, drama, grifting, shill, and unsubstantiated conclusions when I *should* have been keeping up with the latest TJ Holowaychuk creations and Rob Pike musings.
