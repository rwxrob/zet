# Remote YouTube content creation demands unlimited upload service

With a three hour video in 4K taking 40GB of bandwidth there is simply no way a 100GB hotspot plan will ever work. Obviously, not everyone wants a video that big. But it is a good point of reference. The only options left are the unlimited plans like Verizon Internet Gateway and StarLink.

This explains why all the RVs and overlanders have Starlink even when not fully "wild" and they could get mobile access.

This also motivates me to live in an apartment, house, or hotel going forward (instead of living out of my car for any length of time) where Internet speeds are garaunteed. I already needed minimal speeds for working on the road, but this further solidifies that demand since I cannot even do the fun stuff without it, live or not.

I can, obviously shoot a lot of video on a highly remote trip and then come back, edit it, and upload it. Obviously, that is what most action YouTubers do. The difference between them and me is that I want to *do* the activity, not spend more than 20 minutes editing anything. These people with drones who regularly pause to capture themselves cycling around a corner and stuff are just not living in a mental space that I ever want to be. I want to hit record and maybe talk a little bit while doing the activity. If I cannot forget that I'm capturing anything I'm just not into it. I won't be a YouTube megastar that way, for sure, but I'm not seeking that. I'm just capturing my experience exactly as it happens.
