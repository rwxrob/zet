# "This isn't art!" says someone while steaming fine art gallery

I was streaming an exclusive fine-art gallery opening in the Art category and someone yelled at me in the chat for that not being art at all. Sorry, it's not a bunch of lame-ass, big-boobs anime wannabe artists who will never even be a blip in the *actual* art world. I really wanted to tell that person to fuck off, but I didn't I just laughed. I just don't know what category to stream to now. I guess I'll stick with Just Chatting or Travel & Outdoors.
