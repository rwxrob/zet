# First Starlink Mini IRL streaming rig

I've designed a Starlink Mini integration into my standard IRL streaming rig that can be mounted onto my rear-rack of my bike or onto my backpack while walking around. The only difference is the 1" PVC pipe used for each. One has a right-angle in it allowing it to be strapped to the backpack in a vertical position and the other remains horizontal when mounted to the rear-rack. Both can be carried on the rear-rack next to one another allowing easy switch to "walking" mode from biking.

The Mini itself is attached with a Savage ATV quick-release mount and the pipe-fitting clamps provided. The Mini can be swapped between either the horizontal or vertical pipe with a simple quick-release and reattach, even without losing signal (if an externally routed cable is used instead of the weatherproof internal one).

A single 65w Baseus battery powers the Starlink Mini for four hours. It uses a 3' USB-C to DC barrel power adapter cable to connect to the Mini (and optionally routed within the PVC pipe to weatherize it). The battery bank(s) can be stored anywhere but I opt to put it within a waterproof bag as low as possible in my outer pannier mesh to keep center of gravity as low as possible.

The bike mount is semi-permanently strapped to the rear-rack using Voile straps and a bit of foam to prevent the tubing from rotating. At 2.5 lbs the mounted Mini does not provide a lot of rotational torque and a bit of rotation is good to adjust the direction of the mini on long, straight roads. None of this gets in the way of the regular pannier connectors or bikepacking straps.
