# "LinkedIn is the Excel of Recruitment and Connections"

Another outstanding quote from `qmacro` (an rwxrob.tv regular). I really
can't improve on it other than to say, get the fuck off of it and invest
that time building your portfolio and presence on GitHub instead.

Linkedin is perhaps the biggest scam masquerading as a tool
I've ever encountered, and I used to promote it to people. Never again.

Seriously, why the fuck did I waste all that meticulously crafting and
maintaining my LinkedIn profile only to realize they have a full
integration API that only the paid corporations can use. At Linkedin
*we* are the Soylent Green fed to their actual customers. I don't want
anything to do with it. It took me a fucking week to get all my data out
of it and into a nice CV that I can autogenerate different resumes and
sites from, that includes things like recommendations, nice comments,
and referrals from other.

I'm still so mad I fell for that shit. They even try to lock you into it
with all your previous work contacts on it instead of creating *actual*
relationship connections with email and such. They are as fucking evil
as Facebook, if not worse, because they are trying to monopolize and
manipulate your career life without any consideration for what *you*
want. If they actually gave a shit they would let everyone have full
access to their API. The really don't care about anything but sucking
your soul to feed to the people that pay them the highest to find you.
No wonder so many bad recruiters and companies use it. They are evil by
association.
