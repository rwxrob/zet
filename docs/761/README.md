# Q: How do I setup lynx on Windows 10?

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/zdurWFO9etI>

1. Windows 10 is not Linux ;)
1. Get Linux on Windows 10
1. Install lynx with package manager (`apt install lynx-common`)
1. You may actually prefer `w3m` as a beginner (better defaults)
1. lynx is virtually unusable with default config
1. Find someone else's config and use it
1. Not an intuitive configuration setup 
1. Originally design for multi-user
1. Complicated, but worth it (or just use `w3m`)
1. Be patient
1. Do not confuse with `links` (which is horrible)
1. It's not about the graphics
1. It's about rapid scanning in visually consistent way
1. Massive in reduction in cognitive browsing overhead
1. Just use `,` when you want to open in GUI browser
