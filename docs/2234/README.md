# ðŸ’© My ever growing list of SHIT-FOR-BRAINS Web sites

Web developer mentality is ruining the tech industry. The list of examples is too numerous to list here, but I can start by calling out every fucking web site that is TOO FUCKING STUPID to follow their own web development best practices---most notably "progressive" web application development. These mother fuckers couldn't even tell you what it means, yet they are paid to destroy use of the Web by a significant chunk of humanity including the blind and academic who use the Web without a dependency on JavaScript and privacy invasion. At least I can call them out here and hope that some noob web dev finds this and takes away some lesson learned to not be as FUCKING STUPID as them.

Nothing says, "I'm a fucking moron" more than creating documentation sites and forums on the Web that require JavaScript, the *antithesis* of "progressive" web design. (Spoiler alert: "progressive" means use the least available technology available and level up as additional technologies are detected, like, um FUCKING JAVASCRIPT. Almost NO ONE needs that shit!) These morons are literally *destroying* the world wide web one idiotic, fuck-you-blind-person web site at a time. Thank god some of them are actually being sued and paying for it, like PizzaHut.

## Reddit is for FUCKING MORONS!

Here's the error I get accessing Reddit from a text-based web browser. That's right, I'm completely denied any access. Consider Reddit is just a web-based forum why the FUCK do they need this?! They don't. Thankfully anyone with an *actual* brain does not get *any* information from Reddit. They use IRC and sites that most people on Reddit couldn't even access if they wanted to because they are too stupid to understand what Tor even is. The smart people are grateful for the idiot cows who graze on Reddit because they don't fill up their spaces with brain-dead asshole questions. Still, when I get a search hit that goes to Reddit I'm annoyed

Time to get my lynx search to use IRC archives and Tor, which I've been meaning to do.
