# Zwift and NOALBS holding me hostage to Windows?

Update: NOALBS can run anywhere, even another server since it uses Websockets client to OBS. Zwift looks like it will run in a docker container or KVM virtual machine, and since I don't care about performance of Zwift that should be okay. I've decided I really can live without the games that won't run on Linux (easily).

----

I really do miss having Linux on my desktop---especially that I no longer give a shit about playing any games (not even Witcher, it's a cycle with me). In fact, I wish I could just tap the comma and open up a graphic browser from Lynx like I used to do. I *really* miss that. I also miss not being able to play clips instantly with my `clip` script I wrote a couple years back.

So I was sad to discover that Zwift is still a problem to run on Linux (even though, like most things it *can* be done, just not easily, and especially not with integrated with my \$6000 Wahoo KICKR Bike). The absolutely essentials NOALBS for IRL streamers is also a Windows only thing (that I could rewrite in an hour in Go if it came to it).

There are a ton of other Windows deps for live streaming that I haven't even hit yet. Most all OBS plugins are made to *only* work on Windows (for some idiotic reason).

People who push for Linux on the desktop are like I was in my 30s, passionate and naive. While it is true that you *can* get most things to work it is always a struggle and a huge waste of time. Inevitably someone updates something and that very fragile work-around breaks, again. I have spend hundreds of hours "working around" stuff that just works with a few clicks in Windows. At a certain point you just want shit to work (and you no longer have anything to prove to anyone, I mean, I have 50 Linux servers in my cluster that I manage at home and hundreds at work, I don't give a shit if people judge me for running Windows at home on the desktop, people who do are just naive and inexperienced).
