# Zettel Category: Figure

A figure is anything that can be captured as a raster image file. The
`zet figure` command has several subcommand that are designed to work
with figures specifically including `zet figure add` which will detect
the last screenshot or file downloaded and automatically create a zettel
for it.

There are very specific rules for the format of figures and have
therefore been added to the ZettelMark specification itself.
