# Different chill playlists for different days

After coworking every day for two weeks the playlist is getting worn out. I'm thinking of adding different types of chill coworking music and cycling through them:

* AmbiantChill
* YogaChill
* HackerChill
* FolkChill
* BeachChill
* Chillhop
* RetroChill

The thing about breaking them out is that later I can combine them back again.
