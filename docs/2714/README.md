# 2x Verizon + Starlink Mini

So turns out the Starlink Mini really does help with higher bitrates. This means the perfect combination is two mobile modems plus the Starlink Mini. If I could get an ATT modem that doesn't risk overage charges that would be the best to have two different providers, the biggest in the states.

Cost is pretty steep (about 200) but covered by a month of Twitch streaming
with an average of at least 20 or so people. I've never been a big streamer,
but I'm able to pull those numbers usually.  I might get a few more now that
I'm back to doing this every day at the same time. Things always drop off when
I'm inconsistent because people develop habits.

This is with the limited 50G for Starlink. I'm going to see if I can pull that off with only one 9 hour stream per month (headed to downtown Charlotte for Critical Mass). If not, I'll bump back up to the 165 for unlimited. I'll try this for the month of October and see how things go.
