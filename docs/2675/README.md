Been watching a lot of <https://www.youtube.com/@matryderadventures> as he does the TransAm his way. Doris loves Mat as well. He's got a great personality.

Hey look at this here thing I am typing on my Macbook Pro 14" while livestreaming it to my friends. Yep, looks like a new era of streaming directly from my laptop. It's hella comfortable and more portable so I can do it anywhere, including with my Starlink from the coffee shop or bikini beaches, etc.
