# Netgear Nighthawk Home Router + NoIP.com + OpenVPN + Tunnelblick

It was rediculously easy to get my home VPN setup using the built in support for OpenVPN in my Netgear Nighthawk home router. All I had to do was add a free noip.com dynamic DNS and change a few VPN connection settings on my router from the admin page. Then I just installed the Tunnelblick client on my Mac laptop, renamed the unzipped folder downloaded from the router itself with a `.tlbk` extension and double clicked it to start up the VPN client. Now I can use my laptop exactly like I was sitting at home from anyplace in the world.

Incidently, this means that I can control my OBS from which I stream from there as well over VNC.
