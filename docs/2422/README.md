# DaVinci Resolve has Mac, Windows, and Linux versions

If I knew nothing more about DaVinci Resolve other that they fully support a Linux Desktop veron I'd already want it over Adobe Premier, but add the fact that it costs 300 one time (no subscription necessary) and is preferred by most of Hollywood filmakers and I'm not regretting my decision at all. (It is also written in C++ proving just how much better C and C++ still are than Rust at creating world-changing software that matters.)
