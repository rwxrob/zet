# Zettlr 3.0 Review - COMPLETELY BROKEN! Stay away (for now)

Looking at the "biggest update in Zettlr history" to consider moving to it as a standard for personal publishing, note taking, and knowledge management based on well-established Zettelkasten method. But turns out, Zettlr does not even synchronize file changes and has a buggy "save" (but it apparently has grid mode).

Other reasons I won't be using it:

* Prefers use of * to _ for italic (even though setting can be changed).
* Lacks any standard MD specification to follow ensuring migrations work.
* Fails to show any "view source" to see actual markdown text (tables, etc.).
* Fails to properly save, period.
* Fails to recognize changes to underlying files (like including code from terminal vim session).
* Just using Pandoc underneath (which I can do myself).
* Overall beta feel to quality of tool itself.
* Untrustworthy use of "researchers using it" without references.

On the whole, I *really* wanted to love this and ended up making similar conclusions to those I made 2+ years ago. I'll never use it. It is far more important focusing on an RFC specification for a zettelkasten or knowledge node (like KEG) than investing in one application team's idea of what something should be.
