# Decided never getting a fixie, too damn stupid

They might be "cool" but they are hella stupid. I just read a horrifying story of a guy who lost his chain on a fixie and have absolutely zero way to stop besides bail off the bike. That is just moronic. A single-speed is just as sleek as a fixie except it comes with breaks and allows the rider to shift over the seat to prevent going over the handlebars. It also is the same as my mountain and touring bikes. It is just too easy to get into the habit of using breaks only to discover you don't have breaks on your fixie the few times you ride it. Either ride *all* fixies or none. Just the risk of throwing a chain is reason enough for me to *never* use them and look at people who obsess about that as being the potential organ donors they are.
