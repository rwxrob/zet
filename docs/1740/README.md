# My terminal is at 100 columns now (without wrapping)

After several weeks of having wrapping off I've realized that on my 100 column width screen that wrapping at 100 (or not even wrapping at all) is definitely making my life easier working with other people's code. I have yet to come across a code base that goes past 100 columns per line.

The only reason I was using 72 before was because of text-based documentation and because I wanted my videos and screen to be readable from a phone without extra zooming in. I personally hate watching videos from a phone where you cannot see the screen at all. I still stand by the 72 max runes for a keg content node title as well since that allows it to fully display with its id and last changed time when searching.
