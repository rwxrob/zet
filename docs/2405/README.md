# Linux terminal and coding can be streamed from anywhere

It's not hard to stream coding and terminal stuff, including Kubernetes. Laptop and Internet are all that is needed. A camera and good mic is nice, but not essential. So a nomadic life living in different wild camping locations with a Starlink is totally not going to ever inhibit the ability to live stream such content.
