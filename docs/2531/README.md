After doing the research, there is just no comparison even to the Action 4. The DJI Pocket 3 has significantly better low-light performance without any blurring, plus it comes with a gimble that can be locked, which is ideal for cycling when constantly standing and hunching over. The ultra-wide is accomplished with an actual lens attachment instead of digital processing and automatic focus is much better—especially when also using it at a webcam. But the single biggest reason to get a Pocket 3 for IRL cycling streaming is the built-in DJI mic receiver. That's one less thing that has to be plugged into the Belabox and there is no "Analog direct" requirement. It also provides full support for binaural audio because you can attach two transmitters at the same time. But even that is not the main reason. The real reason is battery life. The receiver is always the weak link in battery life. With the Rode Pro I can only stream four hours maximum before the receiver battery gives out (despite the six hours marketed). This really sucks because you cannot plug in the receiver into a battery without getting ungodly interference noise. So even though I could use both transmitters to double the battery life of the transmitter, the receiver blocks streaming anything longer than four hours. This is absolutely unsustainable given the fact that the Orange Pi Plus with a single 30,000 mAp battery can power 15 hours of streaming. The Pocket 3 removes this limitation entirely drawing power from the battery itself to power the Pocket 3 instead of going through the external transmitter bottleneck. The batter of the DJI transmitters is also much higher than the Rode. I have done more than five hours on a single transmitter in mono. That's 10 hours without any transmitter recharging, but for 15+ hour streams all I need to do is rotate the DJI transmitters and charge the other while using the one. Plus, the Pocket 3 has a much better microphone situation built into it enabling the best digital blocking of wind noise possible—much better than anything with the Action 4, which further complicated wind screens by putting the light sensor right between the two microphones making it almost impossible to use them. Plus the Action 4 mic is way to hot and cannot be easily adjusted. All the stuff for the Pocket 3 (mounting extension, etc.) come in at around 700, about double that of just a single Action 4, but this includes the built-in DJI mic receiver and a gimble so that cost is easily worth it. The DJI Pocket 3 attached to a solid chest mount/backpack combination is—by far—the best action IRL streaming solution in existence today. Experience is proving this to be true every day. I can even run with this setup without a problem. I've *never* been able to do that without seriously disrupting the viewers. We have reached IRL action streaming nirvana. God bless DJI. They have a fan for life in me.
