# I never really wanted to be a digital nomad by bike

Recently, I felt the pull of DNB living again and even wrote a zettel that I deleted after I got through writing most of it because it helped me realize just how much I do *not* want to live a DNB life. What I really want is to *not work* and be able to bike wherever I want, preferably away from traffic, so just the B part of DNB.

Currently, I can do bike away from everyone for three days at a time right now, and for a full week in December (when I'm forced to not work because of being a contractor). And as soon as our finances are in order, I can take months or even a year off at a time. If I maintain my health into retirement age I can just bike wherever the I want for the rest of my days as soon as I turn 62.
