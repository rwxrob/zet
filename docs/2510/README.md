# Digital Nomad by Gravel+ Bike (DNB)

I've been attempting to balance work and adventure cycling for over two years now and have concluded that my job is just not conducive to the interruptions. It makes me really sad to write that. If I were single and only had myself to worry about financially and relationship wise I could *totally* do it without a problem at all because I would have unlimited funds to spend on the best hotels and food along the way. I cannot believe what life would be like on my salary without any financial obligations. I have lived a life connected to many other people who need my support in a lot of ways and a DNB life just doesn't work.

What *does* work is working remotely from home and around town at different places and planning the occasional work-free adventure with a beginning and an end. This is how most humans do this sort of thing anyway. There are other advantages to this approach:

* Time with family, friends, and dog especially over the holidays
* Can be done with others in an organized group
* Better daily routine when not adventuring
* Consistent good food options (food options on the road are inconsistent)
* Cheaper per year, yet more money on adventure
* Can focus on strength training and building base
* Allows meticulous planning of the routes instead of "winging it"
* Allows creation of educational video content and livestreaming

A lot has happened since reading the earlier entry. I'm now very seriously considering crossing the country doing the TaT trail in 2025. Here's what I've realized since that last entry:

* I do not care about going fast---especially now that I'm a lot more fit
* Livestreaming keeps it fun and safe
* Mostly off-road routes exist that have almost zero traffic (but lots of mud)
* Pulling a single-wheel, all-terrain cargo trailer is actually preferable for GDMBR
* Starlink Mobile Priority allows me to work from literally anywhere in US
* I only have to work six hours a day if I work every day
* I can bike for five hours a day
* Fully loaded I can average 16 kph in rough terrain
* I can easily cross the country (about 6000 kms) within four months
* I'll be able to fund most of it with streaming and YouTube from Boost
* Verizon accounts will be paid off within year allowing Starlink switch
* The TaT goes through Troutman, only 10 minutes from my house

Recently, I felt the pull of DNB living again and even wrote a zettel that I deleted after I got through writing most of it because it helped me realize just how much I do *not* want to live a DNB life. What I really want is to *not work* and be able to bike wherever I want, preferably away from traffic, so just the B part of DNB.

Currently, I can do bike away from everyone for three days at a time right now, and for a full week in December (when I'm forced to not work because of being a contractor). And as soon as our finances are in order, I can take months or even a year off at a time. If I maintain my health into retirement age I can just bike wherever the I want for the rest of my days as soon as I turn 62.
