A lot has happened since reading the earlier entry. I'm now very seriously considering crossing the country doing the TaT trail in 2025. Here's what I've realized since that last entry:

* I do not care about going fast---especially now that I'm a lot more fit
* Livestreaming keeps it fun and safe
* Mostly off-road routes exist that have almost zero traffic (but lots of mud)
* Pulling a single-wheel, all-terrain cargo trailer is actually preferable for GDMBR
* Starlink Mobile Priority allows me to work from literally anywhere in US
* I only have to work six hours a day if I work every day
* I can bike for five hours a day
* Fully loaded I can average 16 kph in rough terrain
* I can easily cross the country (about 6000 kms) within four months
* I'll be able to fund most of it with streaming and YouTube from Boost
* Verizon accounts will be paid off within year allowing Starlink switch
* The TaT goes through Troutman, only 10 minutes from my house

Recently, I felt the pull of DNB living again and even wrote a zettel that I deleted after I got through writing most of it because it helped me realize just how much I do *not* want to live a DNB life. What I really want is to *not work* and be able to bike wherever I want, preferably away from traffic, so just the B part of DNB.

Currently, I can do bike away from everyone for three days at a time right now, and for a full week in December (when I'm forced to not work because of being a contractor). And as soon as our finances are in order, I can take months or even a year off at a time. If I maintain my health into retirement age I can just bike wherever the I want for the rest of my days as soon as I turn 62.
