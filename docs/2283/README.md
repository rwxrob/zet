# Bloomberg can kiss our collective WFH asses

What a fucking, greedy, piece of shit! This rich, well-invested-in-business-real-estate billionaire isn't even following the policies and communications from his own fucking company when he rants about people not wanting to return to working in the building. This festering pile of hypocritical dung doesn't even spend a single fucking day in the office himself, but he has the gall to attack others who diligently try to make the most out of their days doing the work that makes him rich. This is just another "let them eat cake" moment from the billionaire class that is going to get them all (metaphorically) decapitated eventually.

* Billionaire Mike Bloomberg is tired of remote work 'excuses'---especially when it comes to civil servants: 'This has gone on too long. The pandemic is over'
