# Twitch (chat bot) commands as zettels

I've figured out a way to make my life a lot easier when maintaining those useful commands from the Twitch or Discord command line: put them all into their own zettelkasten entries with titles that match the command. Here's the convention:

* Commands begin with exclamation point
* Title consists of nothing but commands separated by spaces
* First command is main, subsequent are aliases
* First paragraph is under 380 characters [500-len(url)]
* Rest is further explanation that can read by clicking link

This is one of those times when the get-out-of-your-way approach to zettelkasten really pays off. People can make it into what they need because it is so foundational and "paper-compatible".
