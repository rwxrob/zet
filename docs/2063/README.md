# Getting the best possible sleep (and recovery)

Sleep, diet, and exercise are the most important things to focus on in order to achieve and maintain fitness.

This recipe for fitness has been the same for millions of years and doesn't take an expert to validate. Why would God make taking care of our most precious gift require any knowledge or skill other than our own experience, observation, and intuition? The rest of the animal kingdom has no problem maintain fitness when left undisturbed. Humans, however, have let their brains get in the way, inventing "agriculture" thrawrting millions of years of evolutionary balance in a few decades.
