# Amazon is actually the easiest for a DNB

The last thing I want to do is look all around for something I need. If it can be ordered from Amazon and I am anywhere near an Amazon locker location I build up a cart over time until I am there and then make the order just before I arrive. Then I can shelter-in-place until the stuff comes. So many things aren't even available in big cities, let alone the cities I most want to visit while living nomadically as a DNB.
