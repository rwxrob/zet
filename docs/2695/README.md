So after 10 hours of streaming from the laptop yesterday I realized a few things about livestreaming that I totally forgot:

* I cannot talk for 10 hours straight (kills my voice)
* Streaming pumps up my cortisol, like through the roof
* Long videos are *always* a bad idea (short instead)
* I can't do shit if I'm talking while I do it
* Even the simplest comment can send me on a full-blown tangent

I really have no ability to resist responding to comments as they happen. Monitoring the chat with my phone triggered me because I had to respond to everything. People have told me in the past *not* to even read the chat and when I can remember not to I end up producing better content and code all around. Without a timer or anything I can then check the chat when I'm taking a break without overthinking it. I'm a chronic over-thinker.

So I've concluded to do most of my streaming without even reading the chat, soft of like that shitty "live_programmer" person who just puts coding on repeat and calls it live.
