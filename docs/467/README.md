# Bonzai Could Literally Do Everything

Was talking about the possibilities with Bonzai today and realized that
there is no reason you could not create a `guiterm.Cmd` and start up a
full GUI terminal that runs `bonzai.Shell`. This means that there is
literally nothing you couldn't do. Once you put all your commands,
including the GNU equivalents, you could have an entire portable,
Linux-based operating system throws all the GNU shit out the window
(replacing it will better stuff). Sure it would make me less able to use
UNIX or Linux, but at a certain point who gives a shit. Everything I
ever need is then contained in a single binary that I can run
*anywhere*. As this grows, it could, in fact, become the "age of the
monolith utility" or "the epoch of Bonzai".

I need to stay alive a long time. I have soooo much shit I want to do
with this. Just imaging building all of `keg` into it. Adding the entire
`keg` command line (or even GUI browser) then becomes a *single fucking
binary*. In fact, there is nothing stopping someone from creating an
entire fucking environment in a single binary.
