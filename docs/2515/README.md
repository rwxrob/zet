# Flonase works for allergies

It's taken me literally years to arrive at a solution that works for pet and seasonal allergies. Crete Myrtle has almost put me in the hospital before forcing me to carry an inhaler around with me just in case on my bike rides. Benedryl puts me (and everyone) to sleep and is good for some emergenciesâ€“especially related to acute inflammation attacks. Zyrtec kinda works as well. Claratin never worked. But the steroid stuff in Flonase always seems to work. It's also much more compact and easy to pack. One of the biggest differences I've noticed is that it keeps my nasal passages open so I can breath through my nose, which is absolutely huge for endurance sports allowing the nose to warm the air, filter stuff, and avoid aggravating the lungs.
