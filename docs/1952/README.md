âš¡ (Picture was me at 42.) I've been and done many things in the many years here on Earth. All I can say is DON'T WAIT! You don't need permission. Cease the day. Take risks. Live your best life, while you can.

I've been and done many things including being a dungeon-master, skate-punk, river guide, triathlete, tour guide, Russian and French interpreter, cruise director, Mormon missionary (not Mormon anymore), teacher, father, husband (twice), CEO, Nike's Web master, conference presenter, yoga instructor, meetup organizer, stand-up paddle-boarder, coder, sysadmin, hacker, honorary Samantha Fox body guard, friends with Stalin's great, great, granddaughter, and more.

On a good day I might tell you a random true story:

* Nearly arrested in Russia
* Nearly chopped up by drug-lord machetes on Martinique
* Gave Branford Marsalis (Sting's saxophonist) ride home from airport
* Survived a hurricane that leveled the airport on Martinique
* Tried to have a baptism on a beach with topless French girls
* Made friends with Rastas and freaked them out speaking Creole
* Partied with Olympic snowboarders in Nagano, Japan
* Almost died in a Piper Cub airplane crossing Idaho mountains
* Competed in Nike Masters Olympics as a Triathlete
* Learned to surf in Hawaii on a Madrigal school choir trip
* Dated the SLC Tribune editor as my first girlfriend
* Got my nickname "Pokey the Knee-Rider" from the current Utah District Attorney
* Fished a bloodied moron out of the Salmon river after he didn't listen about white-water
* Ran the ThunderRoad marathon and almost lost the ability to walk for two weeks
* Caught a hacker trying to build a rat's nest on my home Linux box
* Interpreted for a drunk Russian mob boss with prostitutes
* Hung out with Samantha Fox and her posse on tour in Russia
* Started the first paddle-board meetup in North Carolina
* Taught my boys to run every day after school
* Coached a kids soccer team
* Learned to code on an Atari 400 in 1982 while wearing braces and two sets of head-gear
* Saw original Star Wars 20 times *in the theater* in 70s
* Buried family hamster and made a geo-cache out of it
* Finally met and married my artist/"Patagonia girl"

Life has been good, but hard, and I'm not dead yet, so much to do and learn left! Maybe I'll stream some of it. Maybe not.
