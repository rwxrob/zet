# Outdoor coworking

Even though 100% living out of the car as a nomad is no longer something I'm actively considering, having the option to wake up and drive to an "office" anyone outdoors that has reliable Internet over Verizon does seem like something to pursue. I already have all the hardware to do this now that I have the Jackery 300. But the service plans for doing streams longer than a few hours are something to consider since I will quickly burn through my 100 GB "unlimited" plan doing that. Verizon's 35 dollar/month unlimited gateway Internet thing might be an option there. Service-wise, the Verizon Internet Gateway is definitely the way do go, then, we if we have to  boost that signal or combine a sim car fine. More likely, however, I'll just only drive to locations that have absolutely excellent reception.
