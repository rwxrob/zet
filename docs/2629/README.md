# Down at dusk, up before dawn

Since hitting the road I've developed a solid habit of going to bed as the orange glow of the sun fades and getting up in the dark just before dawn. Summers in northern regions of America have morning first light at about 5:30 AM and last light around 9:30 PM. This means I'm asleep for about eight hours and up at 4:30 or 5:00 AM every day. I absolutely love it. I get so much done in the early morning hours before so many people aren't even up.

It is true that I'm still on Eastern time and will have to adjust, I think this is more about just getting in sync with nature. I used to think that all the rhythm stuff was over-stated. But this feels legitimately amazing. I also end up taking a short nap in the afternoon, which so many cultures have been doing forever.

On the road, one downside of getting up that early is the cold, so I end up staying in my sleeping bag and tapping out a few words while in an early morning contemplative state. Sometimes I'll find a Denny's and drink coffee while charging batteries. If I'm on the bike or in the car I'll make it myself. My best brain time is immediately after I've woken up and had coffee. If I have a complex work task it is always the best time to focus on it. When I'm on the bike this works out because it isn't light/warm enough to pack up and get moving, yet.

One advantage I was not expecting was the safety factor. Seems like crooks and wackos aren't around as much at 5:00 AM. Go figure. I'm more likely to feel safe walking to the bathroom (leaving my tent or car or table) at this early hour than other times of the day. I obviously have nothing scientific to back that up, just a hunch. (By the way, I always take my wallet, phone, and laptop with me into the bathroom.)
