# Starlink "high performance" dish is a must for remote digital nomads

Want to live from your Outback and take conference calls and attending business meetings while driving on long stretches of boring highway? As expensive as it is, Starlink Mobile Priority 50GB seems to be the entry point for this functionality. The "high performance" flat dish, which has double the number of antennae, costs 2500 and the monthly rate for 50GB of priority traffic is 250 (even though always unlimited). Compared to the cost of having the same from home (100 for router and 100 per month) that's quite a bit more.

Living out of an SUV or RV is most cost effective when done in a highly remote location on free BLM land where camping isn't restricted. These locations simply do not have moble phone service, no matter how boosted the signal. Living away from other nomads also means you won't be competing for signal with them (or risking running into those with nefarious intentions).

Starlink Mobile allows dependable use of services like Google maps on the road making it much more difficult to get lost.

For safety, being always connected to someone who is keeping track of how and where you are is easier with Starlink. [Even so, if you plan to bike and move some distance away from the vehicle it's probably good to get an emergency satellite messaging service. Some will life-flight you out if you get injured but can still manage to hit the "I'm hurt" button.]
