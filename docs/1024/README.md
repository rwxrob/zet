# 2021 Yearly Goals, Five Year Plan

Here's my personal and professional long-range plan. It changes
constantly.

**2021** is about getting my feet back under me having gone through a
lot of transitions. My main goal is to hit my stride and find a
sustainable balance.

* Close SKILSTAK's physical doors
* Return to full-time corporate work
* Learn Cloud-Native and Kubernetes enough to do my job
* Move all curriculum online
* Build and maintain rwxrob.tv community
* Be present for my wife as she grows in the art scene
* Get healthy again (fit in my Patagonia gear)
* Find a solid place to plan our next geographical move
* Add back a limited amount of gaming for relaxation

I have a lot of micro-projects that together add up to a lot of time:

* Get all my rwxrob.tv bash prototypes in a usable state with full docs
  ready to port to Go later: `zet`, `yt`, `twitch`, `twitter`, `clip`,
  `chat`.
* Refactor `conf-go` and `cmdbox-config` to be in since with
  `template-bash-command`
* Complete `cmdbox-gen` SSG module in Go and plug into `zet` bash script
* Get all SKILSTAK content into a public or private archived repo of
  some kind
* Complete 2021-2022 Beginner Boost content organization and plan
* Clean up and migrate off of GitLab
* Port all previous knowledge base content (about 2000 zettels) into
  current `zet` repo

**2022** was going to be the year we move out of our apartment, but
looks like Doris will have a studio holding us here for at least another
year, which is fine. 

* Reconnect with boys (travel and do digital nomad thing)
* Figure out streaming from the road for rwxrob.tv and rwxrob.live
* Get CKAD, CKA, and CKS
* Complete the 2022 Boost content
* Release `CmdBox` into full production
* Release `PEGN` into full production
* Begin port of rwxrob.tv tools from bash to Go as `mim`

**2023** and beyond includes a move and lots of other stuff that doesn't
fit into these other years:

* Redesign skilstak.io as interactive tech learning game
* Update previous Boost content
* Apply to speak at select (relevant) in-person conferences
* Kick off afk.works and seek organizers
* Revisit the Knowledge Exchange Grid (KEG)
