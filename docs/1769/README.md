# Q: How do you do interactive git staging?

ğŸ“º <https://youtu.be/8st1NhaKDCA>

`git add -p` or `git commit -p` opens up an interactive "hunk" add or commit. Play around and practice to figure it out. But it is rather useful. It's mostly just a matter of knowing "partials" or "hunks" exist. I didn't.
