# Four-day bike tours

The daily routine would look something like this:

* Depart at 9am from home
* Bike until 12pm (3 hours), stop for lunch
* Bike until 3pm (3 hours), check in to hotel
* Shower, nap, change, charge
* Dinner and explore from 4-9pm

There's no work happening on these tours. These are just pure fun. This means no need to lug around that remote home office.

At 10 mph that gives me a 60 mile daily range, so 240 miles total not counting exploring the daily destinations.

Assuming the high-end of prices, that's three nights at 60-150 per night, so we'll say 180-500 for lodging. At 50 per day for food that's 200. And incidental "fun" costs about 25 per day, so another 100 or so. That's very roughly 500-800 per trip. Such a trip can be done for much, much less, but knowing what the top-end is helps set up the right expectation. Honestly, that's not really a lot considering how much most vacations *can* cost. For example, that wouldn't even cover the cost of gasoline for most on-the-lake boating weekends.
