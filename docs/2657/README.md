# Four-day bike tours

## Schedule

The daily routine would look something like this:

* Wake up at 7am, pack, breakfast
* Bike 8-12pm (4 hours)
* Lunch and nap, charge Starlink Mini battery 12-1pm
* Bike 1-5pm (4 hours)
* Check into lodging with reservation
* Shower, change, dinner, explore 5-8pm
* Sleep by 9pm latest

## Gear

There's no work happening on these tours, and no camping. These are just pure fun. This means no need to lug around any of the following:

* Remote office
* Sleep system
* Tent
* Cook system
* Chair

This makes packing extremely easy:

* Two light-weight panniers with minimal clothes and rain gear
* One anything bag on the fork with repair/emergency stuff, mosquito net
* One half-frame bag with wallet, keys, snacks, air-pillow, and battery for phone/music
* One insulated 1-liter tumbler on other fork with long straw
* One 1-liter water bottle (usually empty)
* Starlink Mini with two battery packs velcroed
* Sleeping pad on rear rack to pad Starlink and for naps
* Helium Bivy on rear rack for emergency shelter and naps

## Distance

At a faster-than-most-adventure-cyclist pace (since traveling so light) of 13 mph that gives me a 100 mile per day range, so 400 miles total round-trip not counting exploring the daily destinations.

## Budget

Assuming the high-end of prices, that's three nights at 60-150 per night, so we'll say 180-500 for lodging. At 50 per day for food that's 200. And incidental "fun" costs about 25 per day, so another 100 or so. That's very roughly 500-800 per trip. Such a trip can be done for much, much less, but knowing what the top-end is helps set up the right expectation. Honestly, that's not really a lot considering how much most vacations *can* cost. For example, that wouldn't even cover the cost of gasoline for most on-the-lake boating weekends.
