I've been swooned into using the <https://www.conventionalcommits.org> practices because the ArgoCD and other projects use them to great effect when preparing automated release notes from the messages. This trumps the simpler conventions used up to now.

----

Can't find where I read it (long ago) but here are the conventions I follow specifically for Git commit messages. You'll find these are standard in any project that has a clue (which does not include most Node projects):

* Never longer than 50 characters
* Answer phrase "If I commit this patch it will ..."
* No end punctuation

I *never* include merge commit messages. I refuse to clutter my commit log with stuff that makes no  sense.
