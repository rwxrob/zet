# Golang SQLite3 options, CGO?

To CGO or not to CGO, that is the question. "It depends" is always the answer. If we do, we get some kick-ass speed and official compatibility with the `database/sql` standard Go interface. We also are immediately ready to write a compatible API in C directly. But, building for CGO is a *pain in the ass*.

The problem is that you really pay for performance when you drop the C library:

>    This post summarizes some basic ingestion and query benchmarks using mattn/go-sqlite3 and modernc.org/sqlite. tldr; the Go translation is between twice as slow and 10% slower for both small datasets and large, for INSERTs and SELECTs.

Another advantage of just accepting our CGO fate is that later I can incorporate other C things (more notable for Python stubbing than anything) and be ready for it.
