# Optimal Streaming and Recording Workflow

It's taken almost three years to settle into a flow for live streaming
and producing YouTube videos to go with it all. Even small details make
life so much easier. For example, waiting for 24 hours (required by
Twitch TOS) to "Edit Draft" of an uploaded YouTube video prompts
YouTube to suggest sharing to Twitter, which you can then do with one
click (and without forgetting to do so). This makes a lot of difference
when doing it 2-12 times a day.

TODO: add the rest of the workflow, after updating the YouTube
description sync tool that matches a Text Node.
