# Starlink provides more for less

The Starlink Land Mobility package is 250/month, which is almost exactly what I pay for two Verizon and two ATT accounts now. Starlink provides unlimited 40-220 MBPS download and 8-25 MBPS upload, which *blows away* anything that is possible from any service provider in the United States. The signal is also *always* available from any geographical location on planet Earth that can "see" the sky. I understand now why Verizon is worried. Starlink mobile is changing the entire ecosystem of data service providers.

ATT is just an accident waiting to happen. I once paid 450 dollars in overage charges. I can just to pay-as-you-go prepaid when and if ever needed again. I already spent the money on the modems themselves.
