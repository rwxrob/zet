# Body-mounted camera is better

A DNB is going to be doing a lot of things during the day that do not involve the bike. So wearing an IRL pack/rig is best. Since I'm only on the bike three hours (same as at home) the comfort of wearing a pack is fine. The pack will definitely start to smell, but I will already smell pretty bad so have to figure out how to deal with that.
