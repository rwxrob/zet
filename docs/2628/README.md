# American portion sizes are out of control

It might just be me, but I can digest two eggs well, three not so much. There is a noticeable difference. So when the very attractive pretty young thing at Denny's asks me if I want "four eggs instead of just two" the answer is no.

I got to thinking.

Why are all the portions in America so incredibly, overwhelmingly large?

Do Americans actually eat all this stuff or do they throw it away?

On average, any meal I order from any restaurant, no matter how small, brings me the equivalent of two or even three portions for me (and most humans).

Unfortunately, I cannot change this. I'm not allowed to order the "kid's portion" so I am forced to either throw the food away or attempt to take it with me. Restaurant food does *not* store well in a bear bag.

At least McDonald's allows only ordering a single breakfast burrito, but honestly, I'd rather just have two eggs. Why is that so hard?

I already know the answer. I just don't want to admit it. Many American's aren't only fat, they *want* to be fat and really don't care about it. Some have gone so far as to say that people who even say that they are fat at all are "body shaming" them rather than just reporting medical facts. This attitude has become overwhelmingly obvious by all the time I am spending in places where Americans spend their hard earned money on stuff to eat. So many people have no shame ordering a full liter of sugar water and knocking it back with nothing but fried carbs. It's not that I'm "body shaming" them or that I don't do the same, occasionally. I'm simply making an observation.

As someone in my chat community pointed out, Ozempic sales are skyrocketing. So while people seem to have no shame about their gluttony they actually don't want to look fat and will fork out money they probably don't have to counter the medical results of their over-indulgence. They'd rather take a pill than give up sugar-water.

Some people even get their stomach's stapled rather than do the work (like my mother and father). But these people end up stretching their stomach back out and getting fat all over again, even as their limbs fall off from diabetes.

At this point, these recent paragraphs will have already gotten me cancelled in my groups where I would have a casual conversation in America. You can't even call this stuff out or people get extremely judgemental. Ironically, they would call *me* judgemental for saying something simple like, "95% of the people in the restaurant currently are more than double the stats for medical morbid obesity." I've been branded a "water boiler" before. This is just the same thing. 

"Hey, your body and eating habits have a critical bug that needs to be fixed before the system crashes hard."

That's all I'm doing.
