# I don't really want to bike across America (just drive with bike)

I've been recently tempted to look into doing solo tour across America by bicycle but as I got the question about gear I realized that I would never be able to take all my streaming gear and keep all the batteries charged even with a solar charger.

Instead, the better solution is to drive between towns of interest and then daily 3-hour bike streams from that location coming back to the car or campground to sleep. This way I can really soak in everything interesting that exists in a town over several days without having to be in a hurry.

Another reason is because I can work a full eight hours from any number of places including entirely remotely from my camp site so long as I have one of those industrial batteries to power my laptop and streaming from it. My coworking streams are mostly music and scenery anyway so the only difference would be doing it from my Mac. I would have to bring both Macs anyway because one of them is for work.

I would still want to do the stream relay from home, so having a remote SSH connection into my home system will be key. Another cool thing about that is that I an ssh into that system from my work Mac and switch between work and stream just by changing terminal windows. Hell, I can even leverage all the lab machines I have as needed as well, entirely remotely.
