# Optimal Twitch Ad Break Management

1. Run a 3-minute ad, get 29 minutes of "Pre-roll Off"
1. Take a 8.5-minute music, talking break (until ad enabled)
1. Run a 3-minute ad, get 54 total minutes of "Pre-roll off"
1. Start pomo timer to match 54 minutes
1. Get busy doing uninterrupted stuff

Turns out running a third 3-minute ad break (after waiting 3 minutes)
only gets you an additional 10 minutes of "Pre-roll Off", so doing two
breaks as fast as Twitch will allow gives you the best return on
investment. I also like that for people who are subbed this provides an
opportunity to talk (even if they aren't subbed) and it forces me to
change to casual mode for about 10 minutes every hour allowing me to do
some yoga, push-ups get a drink or whatever. This is exactly consistent
with the 11-off-49-on schedule I have planned for the boosts.
