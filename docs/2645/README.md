# Weekend Warrior DNB schedule: 4 work, 3 ride

How do you manage to get through something as long as TAT or GDMBR and still work an honest week? First of all, what is an honest week (for you)? For me an honest work week requires at least the following:

* 6-8 hours per day Monday through Thursday of highly focused concentration time
* Fridays dedicated to "personal learning" projects
* Rock solid Internet (at least 50/10/30 which Starlink Mini provides when not moving)
* Dedicated power supply to keep devices in full-power mode (Macs lie, always require plug)
* 24/7 phone access (especially when on call)
* Reliable remote access to multi-server home lab for experimentation and development

While it is possible to gamble on having these requirements on any given weekday, it is much less stress to simply plan on staying the night at the same place Sunday night through Thursday night and then plan on pushing hard (with minimal sleep setup) Friday through Sunday night These are also the nights with the most vacancy since everyone *else* has to be at work.

## Focus

This weekly schedule appeals to me because I can really focus on the riding and being present out in the nature and communities I am there to experience, while having zero guilt knowing that I will positively, absolutely be free from worry for the upcoming work week.

Getting pelted with torrential, hurricane season rain? Not a problem. Just stay longer at a safe lodging location, or upgrade to a motel.

## Assumes a pretty big lodging budget

To be on the safe side, 120 dollars per night is a good target, that's roughly 600 per week not counting food. When it is cheaper there is more budget to eat out or make up for the super expensive locations.

## Less power required

Because I'm not working Friday through Sunday I don't have to allocate power consumption for those days (unless I'm livestreaming). This significantly reduces the amount of weight required for battery capacity.

## Not enough time to finish longer rides?

Assuming I pushed my maximum pace on the days I do ride (think old-man Tour Divide, about 100 miles per day) then I would be doing 300 miles per week (just in three days instead of all seven). That's 40 miles per day-ish (a typical "slow" adventure cycling pace). So the pace per week can be used to calculate total number of days needed for longer trips. So the GDMBR is 3083 miles. That would be 77 days, easily under the 80 threshold to safely complete in "one season".

The trick is maintaining the level of logistical efficiency and physical fitness to push 100 miles per day when required.

## Periodization

I love to push myself physically. I also love seeing interesting things. The reason this elite-DNB schedule appeals the most to me is because it really pushes me in this way but gives me a full week to recover. This fights off burnout that so easily creeps into Tour Divide intensity. It also allows me to really get to know a place while spending five lazy nights there wandering around after work.

## Not "Warm Showers" friendly?

One downside of this schedule is the number of nights of lodging required that stretches the welcome of anyone willing to put me up. Usually, people camp out for a night on the lawn and move on, not for a week.

Still, on the two nights of intense riding these would be absolutely ideal for a WarmShowers host and welcome given the absolute intense pace.
