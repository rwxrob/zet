# DNB 4-3 work/ride weekly schedule

How do you manage to get through something as long as TAT or GDMBR and still work an honest week? First of all, what is an honest week (for you)? For me an honest work week requires at least the following:

* 6-8 hours per day Monday through Thursday of highly focused concentration time
* Fridays dedicated to "personal learning" projects
* Rock solid Internet (at least 50/10/30 which Starlink Mini provides when not moving)
* Dedicated power supply to keep devices in full-power mode (Macs lie, always require plug)
* 24/7 phone access (especially when on call)
* Reliable remote access to multi-server home lab for experimentation and development

While it is possible to gamble on having these requirements on any given weekday, it is much less stress to simply plan on staying the night at the same place Sunday night through Thursday night and then plan on pushing hard (with minimal sleep setup) Friday through Sunday night These are also the nights with the most vacancy since everyone *else* has to be at work.

## Focus

This weekly schedule appeals to me because I can really focus on the riding and being present out in the nature and communities I am there to experience, while having zero guilt knowing that I will positively, absolutely be free from worry for the upcoming work week.

Getting pelted with torrential, hurricane season rain? Not a problem. Just stay longer at a safe lodging location, or upgrade to a motel.

## Assumes a pretty big lodging budget

To be on the safe side, 120 dollars per night is a good target, that's roughly 600 per week not counting food. When it is cheaper there is more budget to eat out or make up for the super expensive locations.

## Less power required

Because I'm not working Friday through Sunday I don't have to allocate power consumption for those days (unless I'm livestreaming). This significantly reduces the amount of weight required for battery capacity.

## Not enough time to finish longer rides?

Assuming I pushed my maximum pace on the days I do ride (think old-man Tour Divide, about 100 miles per day) then I would be doing 300 miles per weektday (just in three days instead of all seven). So the pace per week can be used to calculate total number of days needed for longer trips. So the GDMBR is 3083 miles or 

Even at my best the GDMBR would take me a good 40 days to ride. Using this method for every three days of intense riding add four more of doing nothing but working and recovery. This would push a rather leisurely 40-day GDMBR trip


## Not "Warm Showers" friendly?

One downside of this schedule is the number of nights of lodging required that stretches the welcome of anyone willing to put me up. Usually, people camp out for a night on the lawn and move on, not for a week.
