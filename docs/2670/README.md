Had a moment of reflection about what I want to do on Twitch, specifically, if I want to do [reruns](../2669). The answer is no, reruns are not "live." The end.

Yesterday did a test of the IRL rig for the bike since reworking it. I realized that the Orange Pi Plus doesn't have the power for three wifi dongles when powered from a Baseus 30,000 mAh 5v/3a USB-C cable. (The Plus actually takes 5v/4a but has worked for more than a year with the 3a.)
