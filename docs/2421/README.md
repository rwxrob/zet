# No tubeless, no electronic shifting for me

Here's yet another reason to avoid all that unnecessary shit that just breaks in a way that cannot be fixed on the road. In this video, the wonderful biker cannot get their double-century started because their tubeless tires are shit and cannot hold pressure and their battery-dependent shifting just decided not to work. No thank you. I'm fine with my unsexy bar-end, friction shifters and slime-tube tires that work no matter what.
