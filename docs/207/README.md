# Linux/UNIX Flash Card Idea

I made a business in college out of creating flash cards for language
learning. Now, after moving to a *Linux Beginner Boost* badge idea, I'm
wondering if creating a flash card app for each of the main commands
would be fun for people to use. It certainly would be fun to just go
through them on the train or something to remind yourself of the syntax.
It really is like learning a foreign language and you have to commit
certain dashed options and such to memory just like the vocabulary of
any language. I'm realizing this approach is more of an option now.
