# One adventure per month, one month adventure per year

Been really enjoying the code sessions at work today and feeling the pull to code and connect with my livestreaming technical community again. I'm not gonna lie. I love developing things I want from the command line every day. I really do miss it the more I'm away from it. Plus, I'm fucking great at it.

However, I never want to give up my renewed connection to the outdoors. Now that I've realized that living as a digital nomad by bike is unrealistic for someone like me I'm left with an opportunity to find a balance between my obsession with the outdoors as well as coding and contributing to open source things like KEG.

My conclusion, as usual, is a balance between the two.

One long bikepacking trip per month will be more than enough to keep me motivated and super-charge my gratitude for living indoors after living without regular amenities. The rest of the month I can put in the miles locally and sleep overnight at home rather than in a tent so that I still have time to be with Doris and my livestreaming friends. My training will remain consistent, just located in places that don't demand as much preparation or attention.

In addition, one *entire month* per year of bikepacking will allow me to do Tour Divide and things like it, eventually. Now that Doris has a significant income taking a month off per year is a very real possibility within the next year or two after we move. I'm planning on it.
