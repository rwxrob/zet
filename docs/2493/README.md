# Why did I ever use Wordpress?! ğŸ¤¬

I have over one hundred entries in my wordpress.com bikepacking blog and to get any of that content over into my zettelkasten I have to manually copy and paste every fucking document. What the FUCK was I thinking?! If I had done it in markdown to begin with I could have just rendered it differently and swapped whatever rending engine in that I wanted. Again, I'm feeling really stupid lately.
