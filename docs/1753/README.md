# Square merchant tap-to-pay to your phone

My wife just got tap payments to her working through her iPhone so at the Christmas market people can pay here without needing to swipe anything, just tap their card on her iPhone. Looks like the same thing is coming out for Android as well. This is amazing for any kind of remote point-of-sale and frees us people to make money in all sorts of ways that could have been impossible before.
