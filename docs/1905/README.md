# Twitch pomo-radio format and multiple categories for 2023

On January 14 it is three years of streaming on Twitch. The format has changed a lot over the last three years, but I feel like I finally hit what this is all about. I call it "pomo-radio" specifically for knowledge workers (coders, hackers, and the like) but anyone is welcome. Basically, as long as I'm awake and relatively close to the computer I stream music and whatever I'm doing, then take a 10 minute break at the top of every hour to answer questions about anything and everything.

This works for IRL as well since it is just a different scene. That means I can do yoga, go skateboarding, hiking, or just code and keep the stream just running with the same format. I will have to get good turning the music down on the breaks while IRL, but there are commands for that. I might even have to just make a better NoALBS bot to control my home system whenever I (or a moderator) types something specific. Spotify and YouTube music volume will definitely be a big one. I won't be able to just grab the sound board on the break.

Here are the categories I'm planning and what it'll be:

***Just Chatting a lot more when I'm not actually doing any coding.
