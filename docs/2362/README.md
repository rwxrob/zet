# Wife says no streaming of the apartment, no cooking streams?

Doris hates sharing the inside of our home with the world, and honestly I don't blame her. I certainly don't have a problem with it but I understand that people do. I was going to do cooking streams and stuff and can't do that now, or can I...

Now that the goal is to be working from the road most of the time I could just change to a 'cooking from camp' thing instead. After all, I don't cook all that much and when I do I tend to prefer my cast iron stuff anyway. The thought of grilling fresh trout just makes my mouth water. (Doris could never be around me doing that or she would die.) No, there's no reason I couldn't do that kind of cooking on the road. Usually I don't even cook that much at all, just slice up veggies, make guac, and make protein smoothies. I've done all of that from the car long before I even met Doris when going on long trips to the beach.
