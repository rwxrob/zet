# JupyterHub Kubernetes Officially Launches Helm

June 9 version 1.0.0 helm chart was released and 25 June 1.0.1. The
important thing here is that the last helm chart release was January 15
(0.11.0). This means that the JupyterHub people feel that their Helm
package is solid enough for everyone to use. This is very encouraging.
It means that more organizations will be able to deploy JupyterHub into
Kubernetes without the pain currently associated with it (which I have
been fighting with for a month building my own, basically). I hope that
more schools and universities will be able to do this easily.
