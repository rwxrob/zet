# Hot shower and soft bed is bike-rider bliss

Yesterday after an amazing three hour Fall ride ending perfectly at sunset all I wanted to do was get a nice shower, eat some dinner, drink some beer, and pass out in my cozy bed and because I was only 20 minutes away from home I just had to drive there and make it happen. This seems like an obvious thing to point out, but to someone considering a nomadic life on the road it's important to realize that you are *permanently* giving that up. To a guy like me, that's a tough sacrifice---especially when there are very satisfying alternatives.
