# Stop requiring tokens be environment variables!

I don't know what is with this generation of programmers who think it is safe to put tokens and secrets in environment variables, even if there is separation of environment based on user login preventing multi-user systems from giving these all up to anyone on the system. It's still a fucking horrible idea! Every time someone requires this I have to go to extreme lengths to ensure that my environment is never spilled to my screen. If these idiot developers had done the right thing---requiring these tokens be saved into files instead---then I can be sure to not show those files, which is much less risky. I'm vary sad to say that `charmbraclet/mods` (one of my favorite recent project discoveries) practices this absolutely brain-dead practice. Personally, I think it is container sickness. Docker was so FUCKING idiotic to make passing environment variables to container instances as the only fucking way to communicate with a new instance of a container that now everyone thinks passing *anything* in these horribly insecure env variables is just fine.
