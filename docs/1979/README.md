# Film: Vengeance

Vengeance is one of the best fictional films I've seen about the current situation in America. I really don't want to spoil it for anyone else. So, if you haven't seen it yet. Stop reading now and go watch it first.

***SPOILER ALERT***

The writing is beyond amazing compared to most shit getting put out by the streaming services these days, just so many great quotes:

* "We are all just inspirations for the *record* of ourselves."

I love that the vessel for all the greatest evils of our day, the prophet who accepts our current fate to be perception managers forever, ends up with a fictional bullet in the head.

Personal broadcasting, culture journalism, and, yes, influence are not themselves evil at all. They are as miraculous and powerful as nuclear energy, and just as destructive. The problem lies in how we use this amazing power, to shine a light on the truths of humanity, as ugly and beautiful, or to mask it with reality fiction designed to manipulate by manufacturing what people think to be real.

It was a friend on Facebook who saw my doubts about Mormonism and gently led me to the water of truth.

It was plentyoffish.com that brought me the woman I just didn't think could ever exist, who's now my wife.

It was Twitch where I gained so many friends who laugh at my jokes and make me laugh when no one in the near physical vicinity ever could.

The Internet is a fucking miracle, and yes people are using it like a weapon, and we need to defend ourselves against them with the same vigor. But the Internet isn't *evil*. People are evil, and good. And most people have a balance of both in them.
