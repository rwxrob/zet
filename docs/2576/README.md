# RealVNC is better than Windows Remote Desktop

I went ahead and got the very affordable RealVNC Cloud account so that I can just click on an icon on my laptop and immediately pull up my machine at home. It's amazing how little lag there is.

In fact, I've often livestreamed from my laptop but been doing things on the streaming machine itself. I can still send the video feed over Belabox for the camera and the difference between my doing something on the screen and my talking about it is under a few seconds so it is still logical and synchronized. In fact, it is *so* easy that I find myself even using it at home so that I don't have to sit at the desk the whole time.

Best of all, it doesn't break the sound drivers.

Now that I know RealVNC is the thing to use, the option to use Linux for the livestreaming main computer becomes a real possibility because VNC is well-known for having very strong Linux support. My hesitance is still all the crap I had to go through on every single OBS upgrade to get the graphic drivers to work properly for Linux streaming (anti-screen-ripping, etc.) I probably will just keep Windows if for no other reason than the fact that I can actually use Zwift without any other changes when and if I stream from the apartment sometime.
