# Rust Community is Absolutely Insufferable

> [Rust] is and always will be political. (Rust Core Team)

I fucking hate the Rust community. I would overlook any advantages of
the language simply because of this fact alone (if there were not tons
of other reasons not the least of which is its butt-ugly syntax,
falsehoods about "safety", laughable concurrency model, and lack of
anything significant to be made in it while Go has dominated the
cloud-native landscape even though they came out roughly the same time).

I'm sure just writing this in my personal zettelkasten will stir up the
stinking "political" zombie crabs to attack yet again, but I don't give
a shit. People have to know this before getting involved with them, at
all.

I've worked with some toxic assholes before, but the Rust community is
hands down the worst community I have ever been forced to respond to.
Just for disagreeing with them on the language usage I have been
targeted in the past for personal harassment. I have never known such
things to originate from the Go or C or Python communities (although the
Node community is rife with such examples).

I shared my initial impressions about Rust on YouTube casually and had
an entire Reddit post dedicated to personally attacks against me. The
fact that they turned to Reddit for the attack says tons about this
community all by itself. Most don't even know what Usenet even is, and
still think that is a good thing.

I was banned from the Rust Twitter account simply for disagreeing with
them. Then apologists started jumping on me saying that the Twitter
account maintainer did not represent the language or the community. What
the actual fuck?

Now I read example after example in the Linux mailing list of the same
repetitive bullshit attacks against some of the most respected
developers the world has ever known. It's like they think they are
revolting or something, all while wrapped in `unsafe`. It would be
rather laughable if it were not so sad and disturbing.
