# Places for a DNB to eat, drink, dump, and recharge

## Good

## McDonald's

The food might not be very good or healthy, but the facilities as most McDonald's restaurants are top of the line with outlets and sometimes even USB charging outlets at every table. Plus, these days you can reserve a table and order to have it sent to the table without even going to the front desk so you can sit down, plug in, and get to work.

## Not good

### Wendy's is horrible

Unlike other fast-food restaurants like McDonalds, Wendy's does not provide plug outlets anywhere in their dining rooms.
