# Cannod huddle (conference call) at McDonald's or Taco Bell

Today a spontaneous huddle was killed because my bluetooth noise cancelling headphones freaked out. After extensive testing I noticed that even with it on the ambiance of the dining area was impossible to eliminate. I plan on getting a gaming bluetooth headset and spending a bit more to see if I can get around this issue.
