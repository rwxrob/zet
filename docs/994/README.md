# Go (golang) is far more secure than rust

Here's yet another example[^1] of why Go beats Rust at every level of practical security considerations. Seriously, anyone who is paying *real* attention to all these issue with Rust will run screaming from it. It's a disaster. Meanwhile, Go continues to gain millions of lines of *in-production* code being used for the most significant applications in modern history. Rust has nothing. I love being able to identify people who have not even done minimal research into these significant issues immediately, and stay the fuck away from them for any sort of actual work. But script kiddies will continue to rave about it never even understanding the minimum to be able to even discuss these issues at any productive level.
