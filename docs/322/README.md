# Install Elasticsearch (ECK) Colearning

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/uCyM5zwa9Ss>

1. What is Elasticsearch and ECK? (Elasticsearch Cloud on Kubernetes)
1. Consider installation methods:
    1. `kubectl apply -f ...`
    1. Helm Chart
1. Which Kubernetes cluster should we use?
     * Rumor has it Minikube doesn't work (but we'll test)
     * Let's go with Kind
1. Create a lab repo for GitHub
1. Research on number of Nodes needed
1. Discovered `topology` label for zone affinity and distribution
1. Ranting: DevOps isn't enough (cross-over knowledge needed by both)
