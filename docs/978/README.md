# Greed and Power Have Destroyed Learning

Greed and power have corrupted and destroyed many of our systems of
learning as those in power seek to control what and how we learn usually
in ways that benefit everyone but the person learning. They want
control, paternalistic at best, tyrannical at worst. Both are forms of
oppression that start in the home (according to [Paulo Freire]) and are
perpetuated in our schools, churches, and work enterprises. There's a
reason people want you to learn what *they* want you to learn. There's a
reason asking *why* in most places will get you shunned or derided.
Understanding the reason is, perhaps, the first step in taking back
control of your own learning. You need permission to learn what you want
to learn. Learn in spite of the system, not because of it.
