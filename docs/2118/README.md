# Imma stay in 36x30 (second easiest in cassette) for training

After a considerable amount of research and comparison using <https://www.bikecalc.com/speed_at_cadence> I'd determined that in order to simulate the easiest climbing gearing of a Specialized Aethos or Trek Emonda is to stay in the middle chainring and not go past the second easiest cog in the cassette (easiest is 34). That is *exactly* 36x30 and will be all I have on the climbs on the performance climbing bikes if and when I get one. Shimano Ultegra on both of them is 52/36T by 11-30 cassette.

This is important because I have been knocking out big climbs with max trainer difficulty set in Zwift using the granny and spinning away like there were no hills at all. I have to simulate the difficult of long hills as much as possible so I can build up the FTP and reduce the weight appropriately. Eventually, I might have to actually add seven kilos of weight to simulate the weight of my heavy Marrakesh touring bike.

I'm also going to swap out the 48 for a 52 in the front. That way I can at least know what the actually gearing of a pro climbing bike feels like even if the jumps in the cassette are wider.

By the way, I really don't like that SRAM does 48x10 instead of a 52x11. That's pushing the tight chain torque too much. In fact, the more I learn about SRAM the less I like it. Shimano has really got them beat on the road stuff (still). SRAM chains are objectively slower than Shimano according to independent testing.
