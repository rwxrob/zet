# Twitch isn't really for, um, "active" people

Been watching a lot of Twitch lately and cannot help to realize what a teeny tiny percentage of the Twitch demographic are actually active, healthy adults. Even the boobas are completely out of shape. (Okay, I dropped from 25 to 10 just by writing that on stream live, lol.)

For some reason the active, fit people on Twitch are usually really fucking fit, like too much so. There is only a handful of Twitch streamers who are active, healthy, adults with real jobs, and personalities that I really get into. In fact, here they are:

* DrWD40
* Uglie
* Dima (can't remember his twitch name)
* PeloTom
* RideTheLine
* BikeCurious

I probably missed some and there are other fit Twitch streamers, most are people I would actually want to hang out with for any length of time.

It's kinda sad really. I'm watching the TwitchCon thinking, oh my god.

Am I judging them? Yes. Anyone who claims to *not* be making value judgements every time they interactive or view another human is lying to themselves. We do it all the time to establish who is going to become a part of our community, who we let into our trust circles, and who we look up to enough to want to be around and emulate.

Where are all the active people?

I'm afraid most of them don't have time to participate in things like Twitch. Most of them are on YouTube and just video capture their adventures and share them online (or have someone else share them online, like Mat Ryder, whom I love).

None of this makes me want to Twitch stream any less. Probably because a large number of people who _watch_ Twitch includes very active adults. In fact, I am lucky because a lot of very interesting people seem to find their way into my stream pretty regularly for one reason or another. So even though it is virtually impossible for me to find more than one or two peers on Twitch who livestream enough to want to raid them or consider them friends, I know I can just persevere with my small community. After all, I do it for me mostly, to keep me entertained and informed while I'm out there putting in the miles.
