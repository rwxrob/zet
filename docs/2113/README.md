# My dream road bike: Specialized Aethos Expert

Update: I now think the Expert is better than the Comp and worth the 2800 dollars just for the wheel set and better battery life. Glad I waited to be really, really sure. In fact, I'm in no rush at all. That bike is so expensive I wouldn't want to train on it anyway, too afraid of messing it up. My heavy Marrakesh is perfect for outdoor training in any season on any road. In fact, the *only* reason to get "my dream bike" is when I have money to burn and I've hit *every* personal fitness goal achievable.

This bike has it all and includes a big "fuck you" to the UCI from Specialized as a company. What could be better than that. I love the "riders first" over "aero first" mantra behind the round tube design of this bike.

Originally, the Aethos is nearly impossible to get because they only make 300 of them in the entire world every year and it is simply the best modern road bike ever created for climbing *and* flats. The frame is so light it doesn't qualify for UCI official bike races but who really gives a fuck.

Specialized has Comp, Pro, Elite, and S-Works progression in pricing. The Elite is best because it adds a 2000 dollar wheel set that you would probably want anyway along with Ultegra that has longer battery life and looks better. The paint job on the Elite is also better. They all like the S-Works but are much less money.
