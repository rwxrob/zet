# My dream road bike: Specialized Aethos Comp

This bike has it all and includes a big "fuck you" to the UCI from Specialized as a company. What could be better than that.

The Aethos is nearly impossible to get because they only make 300 of them in the entire world every year and it is simply the best modern road bike ever created for climbing *and* flats. The frame is so light it doesn't qualify for UCI official bike races but who really gives a fuck.

Specialized has Comp, Pro, Elite, and S-Works progression in pricing. The Comp is best because you can add a 1500 dollar wheel set to it bringing it up to the Elite and even S-Works level in performance for much less money. (Thankfully, I'm already on my way to that with my Bontrager Aeolus 50 wheel set.)

The main difference between S-Works and Comp is Dura-Ace and 105. Both are electronic. Rational people don't buy Dura-Ace, not even Ultegra these days. Riding a bike with over-priced componentry (which keeps getting more expensive as you maintain it over time) pretty much broadcasts to the entire group that you are either a rich poser with something to prove (beyond how fucking stupid you are for wasting money on that shit) or a pro with full sponsorship who didn't pay a damn thing.

Engine over chassy is hella more classy. It's like killing someone in a video game with melee punches instead of shooting them.
