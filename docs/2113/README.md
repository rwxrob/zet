# My dream road bike: Specialized Aethos Comp

This bike has it all and includes a big "fuck you" to the UCI from Specialized as a company. What could be better than that.

The only difference between S-Works and Comp is Dura-Ace and 105. Both are electronic. Rational people don't buy Dura-Ace, not even Ultegra these days. Riding a bike with over-priced componentry (which keeps getting more expensive as you maintain it over time) pretty much broadcasts to the entire group that you are either a rich poser with something to prove (beyond how fucking stupid you are for wasting money on that shit) or a pro with full sponsorship who didn't pay a damn thing.  

Engine over chassy is much more classy. It's like killing someone in a video game with melee punches instead of shooting them.
