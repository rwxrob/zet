# Simplify or die

Tour Divide competitors and the epitome of minimalists when it comes to long-term living on a bike in harsh conditions. A DNB just wants to survive and keep their job while traveling between interesting places by bike. Both have a strong requirement to simplify, or die, literally.

It's taken several years of planning to even be able to go out the door on my first DNB adventure because if I do it wrong I lose my job, or die. Every time I failed during preparation attempts it was always because I overcomplicated something. Every time I removed one more thing I got that much closer to being able to succeed.

## How much stress can my body take today?

## What meetings to I have for work today?

## What is the weather today?

## Where can I sleep tomorrow night?

## Where do I eat and drink today?

## Where can I charge my batteries?

## What's the safest route?

## Avoiding distractions

Every time I've failed to answer one of the important questions I've been forced to bail into a hotel or to just not travel.
