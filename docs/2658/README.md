# Two IRL ready-to-go kits

I'm realizing the best way to carry the laptop/remote office stuff is to just carry a messenger bag with the laptop in it. It is literally the only thing needed since the Starlink Mini is a standard part of any cycling kit anywhere I go now. (It is just too incredible to not use everywhere.) This has me thinking that having two different, ready-to-go IRL kits/bags/packs makes the most sense. Grab one for DNB work, the other for just live streaming. Or I could swap them while I'm washing the other so it doesn't stink as badly.
