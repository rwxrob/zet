# Avoid using KEG/Zet for documentation of projects

I used to use my `zet` and `keg` commands to create and manage the `docs` directory of my GitHub projects. Then I realized they were useless unless I also had a web server on them. I've since stopped in favor of just a `NOTES.md` file as people have been doing forever. Plus, issues, PRs and GitHub wiki is better place to document the project.
