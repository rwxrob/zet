# Daily diet

This is the diet that has always brought me my best body composition. All my nutrients are covered every day. Inevitably, it's a hit-n-miss diet that throws off all my health goals---especially when traveling on the road.

* One cup of coffee + six almonds/walnuts + water
* Protein smoothie (chocolate protein powder + PB + 1/2 banana)
* Two eggs (soft/hard) + waffle (light on syrup) + coffee + multivitamin
* Guac + corn chips (1/2 full-sized avocado + 2 Roma tomatoes + cilantro + scallion)
* Coffee
* 1 litre water with electrolyte powder
* Green smoothie (spinach + strawberries + lime + small apple + 2 mandarin oranges + small carrot + 1/2 cucumber + blueberries)
* Dinner (whatever family is having, else scrambled eggs bowl: eggs + guac + corn chips)
* Popcorn
* Protein drink (before bed)

I make two meals of guac per day and keep one in the fridge either for the next day or for dinner if family isn't eating together for whatever reason.

There are some things that are banished from my lips. Even a little of them changes my body chemistry instantly (making me bloated, slow, and inflamed):

* Alcohol
* Fried food
* Wheat
* Sugar
* Dairy (especially cheese, which is really hard)

That last one is tough, because when doing anything strenuous for longer than 40 minutes I have to eat some form of sugar to keep the blood sugar levels high enough. But I prefer to do *everything* in zone two where this is never an issue (although keeping up electrolytes and water is).
