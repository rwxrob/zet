# Daily diet

This is the diet that has always brought me my best body composition. All my nutrients are covered every day. Inevitably, it's a hit-n-miss diet that throws off all my health goals---especially when traveling on the road.

* One cup of coffee + handful of pecans + 2 dates
* [Green smoothie](../2452)
* Two eggs (soft/hard, not fried)
* Guac + corn chips
* Tumeric and ginger tea
* Protein smoothie
* 1 litre water with electrolyte powder (if sweating in afternoon)
* Dinner (whatever family is having, else veggie 3-egg omelette)
* Popcorn
* Protein drink

There are some things that are banished from my lips. Even a little of them changes my body chemistry instantly (making me bloated, slow, and inflamed):

* Alcohol
* Fried food
* Wheat
* Sugar
* Dairy (especially cheese, which is really hard)

That last one is tough, because when doing anything strenuous for longer than 40 minutes I have to eat some form of sugar to keep the blood sugar levels high enough. But I prefer to do *everything* in zone two where this is never an issue (although keeping up electrolytes and water is).
