# Renology is bad compared to Baseus for Starlink Mini

A lot of people are getting the Renology power brick for the Mini and they are giving up a lot of advantages that the simpler Baseus 65w bricks provide.

Baseus bricks can be taken on airlines, Renology cannot.

Baseus bricks have more charging and output options that matter.

Baseus bricks are way cheaper per watt.

Baseus bricks are easier to manage because they are smaller, they can even be velcroed easily to the Mini itself and stashed in different ways on the bike to balance the power.

Baseus bricks charge at up to 85w input by faster charging sources cutting more than an hour off the time it takes for one Renology.

Several Baseus bricks can be charged simultaneous faster than a single Renology.

Renology requires AC charging adapter for fast charging. Baseus just uses USB-C.

Baseus bricks are also well-established in the Belabox world for providing Orange Pi Plus power as well.

Renology provides a bunch of irrelevant stuff like the light, wireless charging, and such. All stuff that will just break in the field.
