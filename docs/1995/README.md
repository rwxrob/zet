# Hugo Go source code is an example of everything *not* to do in Go

The Hugo source code base is one of the most ill-conceived, over-engineered, poorly styled and conceived code bases in all of the Go FOSS community. There are a lot of great examples of good Go programming (like `kind` from BenTheElder) but the Hugo project is written by people who have no fucking idea how to write sustainable enterprise code. Stay away from it if you want to learn *good* development practices.
