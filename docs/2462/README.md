# Tour Divide bike build planning

30% of the riders in 2023 rode Salsa Cutthroats but none of them were in the top five in any category. Just because it's popular doesn't mean it's a good idea. That's likely what they already have and love on their slow bikepacking trips, which is totally fine. When it comes to speed and stability, and climbing torque, everyone seems to be coming around realizing that drop bars were just a stupid trend in the XC category which is what TD really is, a XC mountain bike race on simper terrain than most XC races. It's not a tour. It's not really even "bike packing" as most do it taking their time and enjoying everything. It's a race, even if it is against yourself. The least amount of camping possible is best since staying at a lodge will always be faster, easier, and safer even if it costs more. I'd rather save up more money and be more comfortable while also being faster and safer. But that's me. I *lot* of other people aren't doing TD for those reasons.

I *love* Salsa as a brand and company, but instead of being a Cutthroat trend follower, I want to do something different (and still get another Salsa). In honor of Mike Hall, who died doing what he loved. I want to replicate his record-winning rig as closely as possible (and will say so when asked). Even if it isn't the most comfortable or even suited to my riding style I still want to do it, for him. I don't have a Pivot sponsor to give me a 8000 dollar carbon frame for free so I'll get a Salsa Timberjack aluminium frame and build it up so that it is at least very similar in form and color to Mike's. (Hopefully they won't change it before I get one.)

One advantage is that the XC HT bike I get out of it will work very nicely on all the amazing MB trails around us here in NC, the main "blessed" form of biking in our state.

* Salsa aluminium Timberjack HD frame only weight 4 ounzes more than Cutthroat carbon.
* Timberjack has identical geometry to TD world record holder's Pivot.
* Add KuK Kinesis carbon fork.
* Add carbon wheels, seatpost, stem, and flat-bar handlebars.
* Add Shimano Di2 wireless on Shimano PRO Tharsis carbon 720mm bars.
* Take double gel on bar intersection (like Mike's) for mock aerobar position.
* Add dynamo hub to power garmin and light always.
* Find comparable large handlebar bag like Mike's.
* Add extra spokes taped to fork.
