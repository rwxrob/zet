# Q: What is pomo (pomodoro) and how do I get it?

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/wtRJGkPZ2gM>

The pomo command is a tool I created for doing my own version of Pomodoro method for time tracking (which you can easily search). This video shows how to get mine and incorporate it into your TMUX configuration. My pomo has some things that are not normally associated with such timers:

* Set durations to the top of the upcoming hour
* Set sub-intervals for sprinting within a larger duration
* Get warnings when within a certain distance from the end
* Full Bonzai stateful command branch integration (ex: z pomo ...)

I prefer to take 10 minute breaks at the top of the hour so that people can follow along with me consistently while streaming and such and know when I will be "at the water cooler" next available to chat or whatever.
