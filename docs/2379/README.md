# 2024 plans

* Starlink works better out west where there is very little tree cover
* Temperatures are much hotter in the west (better in late August and September)
* Scenery while live streaming can be boring
* Airline transfers are not possible because of Starlink rig
* Renting car to carry bike and Starlink trailer is problematic
* Need to restock water about as much as power

## General

* Get Starlink bike trailer working
* Road trip from NC directly to SLC (trailer on rack)
* Bike trips from SLC
    * SLC to Logan (and back)
    * SLC to San Diego TwitchCon (and back)
