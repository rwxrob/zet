# "Smart" Contracts are Stupid

The base idea of a "smart" contract includes the requirement that is
*never* have an error in it. It is permanent. This assumption that
people creating "smart" contracts won't fuck it royally up and hand over
millions of dollars or the keys to their kingdom is beyond stupid. I
have to just shake my head every time I read another article like this
one today where a company lost \$32 million before they caught the
"hacker" who just used the bug they published in there "smart" contract.
Yet another reason the entire consensus algorithm and "smart" contract
technologies will land in the trash heap of bad tech, eventually.
