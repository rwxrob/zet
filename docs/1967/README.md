# "Golden hour" Best time to photograph or stream outside sunrise/sunset

The "golden hour" is one hour before sunset or after sunrise. According to outdoor professional photographers it is the best time to capture any video or photography outdoors (wedding pictures, sunsets, and yes, IRL live streaming). Problem is that this changes based on weather and time. There's an app called SkyCandy that gives you a good estimate of what it is going to look like based on the local weather. I love the concept. That way I know to do something indoors, or make sure I'm at the lakeside beach to capture the sunset.
