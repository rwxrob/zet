I've decided after hearing from so many people struggling with employment. I just cannot sleep at night knowing I have some things that could benefit people who are suffering from this current economy. So I'm just going to keep plugging away getting the information out in the fastest way that I know how: short-form YouTube videos made about specific topics that are linked from skilstak.io.

I spoke to Doris and looks like we sort of agreed to not schedule things for Sundays and do stuff together but all the rest of the days are open. Saturdays will be day trips (or multi-day trips) to different locations doing urban bikepacking and staying in airbnbs mostly and exploring those areas. I've decided to drop one of the panniers with sleep kit and replace with laptops so I can potentially work on the road with the Starlink Mini and do live streams both with the IRL rig or the Macbook Pro 14" that I bought with the livestream crew to do this stuff.
