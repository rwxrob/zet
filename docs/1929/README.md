# GitHub decided to stop giving search results

Today a user informed me that `!zetq` stopped working. When I tested it I discovered that GitHub search for my `zet` repo returns zero results every fucking time now, without any warning at all. I'm sure I've hit some invisible boundary at which they start refusing to index the content of a repo. I'm pretty pissed off. This means I have to accelerate the KEG indexing strategy and KEG Web rendering in order to get searchability back. The good news is that it will be way better than whatever everyone has now. I can also use IaaS so that I can make the primary search interface my Twitch IRC channel chat. The bot itself will do the searching and hand over a link to the public facing web pages. Then I just have to create automatic rendering and `rsync` when a change happens. This will get me by for now, until I can finish the rendering of the static search engine in the KEG Web site itself, which can be combined with Google searching as well. I'm thinking of adding a `robots.txt` to my zet though because I do *not* want that shit saved for time and all eternity (unless I say so).
