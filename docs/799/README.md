# Eventual SKILSTAK courses (book + video)

Roughly in order of priority:

1. Beginner Boost, High-Octane to Launch Your Tech Career
  1. Activate Your Autodidact, Learn Like the Best
  1. Conquer the Command Line, Become a Shell Native
  1. Just Enough Networking
1. Polyglot Programming: Learn to Code in Python, Go, and JavaScript
1. Cozy Coworking, Building a Supportive, Motivational Community Online
1. Culture Journalism, IRL Streaming as an Art Form
1. Outdoor IRL Streamers Guide

I suppose these titles are now copyrighted. And I suppose putting this out on Twitter and in GitHub will be the first step to eventually publishing them. Polyglot Programming already has the first two chapters finished. Just found them in my old SKILSTAK stuff and they are pretty damn good. I think it failed in the classroom because we didn't have enough time and the teens were too distracted to focus enough to get through the material, but the organization is very sound.

I thought of having these books be a collaborative effort and getting them published through a community, but that defeats what has become obvious to me is the single greatest advantage of any book: a singular voice and tone. I will have people contribute to the editing and such and be sure to list them on the collaborators or credits page, but the book will be from me as the sole author. Hopefully, it will inspire others to take up writing their own as well.
