# Do you do code reviews?

No. Not unless I am mentoring you. That said, you can still ask in the
chat during the weekly semi-live mentoring and someone might be able to
help. Perhaps I have a moment between sessions. You can also ask in the
Discord.

However, you really need to learn how to do your own code reviews and
feel confident about them by identifying people and projects you (and
others) consider reliable and emulating what they do. Eventually, you'll
get a feel for when your code looks like it would be right at home
within one or those professional projects. Boom, you reviewed your own
code.

Pair programming with a mentor or senior developer is also one of the
best ways to get immediate feedback on your code quality. Many senior
developers started out that way.
