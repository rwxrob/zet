# Q: What do you think of language servers?

They are fine and all, just unnecessary for everything I care about. I am not a fan of automatic code-completion and Go already has a perfect linter that rewrites the file every time I save. I'm a fan of linters but they simply don't require a language server. I find that people who like them tend to be graphic editor users who appreciate tabbing through code and having annoying popups while coding. I just find that too distracting. The overhead is just not worth it to me.
