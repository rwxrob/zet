# Okay Apple is FULL OF SHIT with SIP!

What the fuck!? I can't even change what is in `/usr/bin/bash` due to restrictions built into the operating system itself even though I have root privs. This is so man levels of fucked up I don't know what to say. I love my Macbook, but I can see this sort of shit putting back on a Linux laptop soon.

But the more I think about it. Apple can continue to make fucking shitty, brain-dead decisions (remember when they got rid of the ESC key) and I can just work around them by using an actual Linux system. I just cannot stomach putting `#!/usr/bin/env bash` into everything. I really need to get my Linux server up. Then I can carve it all sorts of ways.
