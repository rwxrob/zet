# Simulcasting live to Twitch and YouTube still banned

Saw Spreezy on YouTube and so checked his Twitch and he was streaming to both at the same time, and he's a partner. But apparently he doesn't give a shit about the explicit ban on simulcasting. I wonder if Twitch will crack down on that, or just not do absolutely anything like for all of the hundreds of DJs playing unlicensed, copyrighted music without saving it into VODs. Legality and policy is so tough to navigate with Twitch.
