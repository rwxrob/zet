# Light beer for active people

I remember since I was a kid seeing the beer ads with active people drinking light beer. At the time I was Mormon so I had no idea what the difference was. Now I do.

Yesterday I had a light IPA with some citrus accents, a Neoteric Stratocaster, by far my favorite IPA. But after having drunk Corona light all week in the 90-100 degree (F) heat I immediately noticed a difference. The IPA seemed to leave me dry-mouthed and dehydrated even though I had been drinking water all day. It wasn't just the meal that I ate with it.

IPAs also trigger my allergies a lot more that other beers. I think it is like having a hay-fever reaction to hops. Light beer has never done that.

Mostly, though, light beer can be chugged to satisfy thirst after a long day's ride or run. It is the perfect post-workout beer, provided I don't overdo it. Not drinking water doesn't help.

Unfortunately, the cost of light beer is the same as the other beer types even though drinking more of them is a lot easier. No way around that.
