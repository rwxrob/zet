# Use of emojis as categorizations in zet doesn't work without help

I've been using the emojis for different things like ideas, films, and such, but it is hard to grep it without extra work. I've decided to stop doing that all together, and instead to raise the maximum number of characters in a zet title to 90. This way people can use short words. Then, when wanted, people can come up with emoji representation of those keywords in the display output for easier visual organization.
