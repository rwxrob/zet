# You "don't want to have revenue"

"It's not about what you earn, it's about what you're worth."

"Which companies are worth the most? Those that lose the money."

"Amazon has lost money every year for the last 20 years and Bezos is the fucking king."

"I don't want to make a little bit of money every day, I want to make a fuck ton of money all at once. ROI!"

"How else would you do this job, cocaine and hookers, my friend."

"Fuck the clients."

"Name of the game: move the money from your clients pocket in your pocket."

"But if it's advantageous for them as well then everyone makes money, correct."   "No."

"We don't create shit. We don't build anything."

"There are two to success: drugs and orgasms."

"Sell me this pen."
