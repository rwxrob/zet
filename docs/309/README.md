# Get on a Linux Terminal

The Linux terminal is the most powerful, ubiquitous tool any
technologist can add to their personal and professional kit. It unlocks
powers and opportunities unimaginable to those bound to graphic user
interfaces. These days getting access to a Linux terminal isn't nearly
as hard as it once was. Choose your own adventure here:

* Install Windows WSL1 or WSL2
* Install a Linux Virtual Machine on Windows or Mac
* Install a Linux Operating Systems on a Computer Hardware
* Get Started with Linux on Raspberry Pi
* Install Docker Desktop on Windows or Mac and a Linux Image
* Create a Linux Server on a Hosting Provider and `ssh` In

Any of these methods will work for the Boost. Remember, however, that
the goal is to get a **Linux** terminal. (Macs are BSD Unix) Keep in
mind that ever single one of these options has significant pros and
cons. Make sure you understand them all before deciding. In fact, it
would do you good in the long run to learn a few (if not all) of these
methods of getting a Linux terminal.
