# Powering a professional digital nomadic life

Being a profressional with a full-time job requires rock-solid power stability (along with [other things](/2385)). This makes living out of one's car difficult, but not impossible.

My initial tests of streaming from parks have all suffered from lack of power. I knew I would going into it, but wanted to see just how far the built in batteries on everything would take me. Turns out, not far, so I bought a Jackery 300 Plus with 100w solar panels for 600 dollars. Most people living from their vehicles get at least the 1000 but I can keep it in the hourse for family if I need something bigger later. This should be able to power everything I need to work for a few days at least including all the streaming gear recharging.
