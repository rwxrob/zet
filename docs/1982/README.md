# No more swearing for me, well, mostly

Less swearing means more thinking, more creativity, and less stress. I can put that energy explosion into thought. Removing swearing from my vocabulary is tantamount to fulfilling the mantra: don't get mad, get busy thinking up a way to articulate the problem rationally and powerfully.

We'll see how well I do. But I'm serious, I want to increase my use of amazing vocabulary without the swearing, not because God told me I'd go to hell for saying "fuck".
