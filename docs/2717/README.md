I love waking up early. Everything is so quiet and I can get so much done, even if a lot of that is just thinking and writing. Ever since I added back ["commutes"](../2715) I naturally want to sleep much earlier and (naturally) get up earlier.

And God, my sleep has been so amazing after adding back the commutes. I also don't have to take something for allergies in the latter half of the day because, for some reason, the commute eliminates it. Could perhaps just be something as simple as sweating it out and then having a second shower every day. But boy do I go through laundry a lot faster. I've had to dedicate an entire small bathroom just to drying out my sweaty, dirty clothes every day. But that's nothing new, kind of nostalgic. I used to have dirty laundry everywhere when doing triathlon training as well. It goes with the gig.

The question is now, can I expect this schedule to be maintainable or not. Is it a part of my ["routine"](../2716) or not.

* [Routine versus adventure](../2716)

I think I can focus on the two hours of work I do daily just to keep up on things. As a knowledge worker I'm paid to know what is going on in the tech realm.  The other six hours are working on a specific project.
