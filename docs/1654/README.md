# Linux Terminal Skills Learning Order

After seeing some teach "customizing the shell prompt" before even
showing people how to edit files or write basic shell scripts it has
become obvious that the order of learning the skills is anything but
obvious, or is it. Here's my suggested order to learn all the
terminal related stuff:

1. Install and Use a Terminal Emulator Application
1. Install and Use Minimal Docker Containers
1. Pull Docker Images and Run Linux Containers
1. Navigate the Bash Command Line
1. Install Linux Software Packages (Using `apt`)
1. Create and Manipulate Files Without an Editor
1. Edit Text Files with `vi` (Then `vim`)
1. Write Minimal POSIX Shell Scripts 
1. Manage Linux Processes
1. Send and Handle Linux Signals
1. Customize Bash (`.bashrc`)
1. Customize Vim (`.vimrc`)
1. Use and Customize `screen`/`tmux` Multiplexors 
1. Use Git, GitHub, and GitHub CLI Tool (`gh`)
1. Manage Dotfiles from GitHub Repo with Symbolic Links
1. Write Dockerfiles to Create Container Images
1. Create Workspace Container (GitHub Repo with Dockerfile)

> I actually think of all of those steps connected with a shell `&&`
operator as if to say, after you finish this and the result is true move
on to the next one.

Note that writing Dockerfiles also requires basic shell scripting
ability. It's mandatory learning for technologists today, in all fields.
Not knowing how to create a simple Docker container is a *serious* gap
in knowledge (as I've come to learn the hard way).

There is a lot of stuff implied in some of these. Take typing, for
instance, all of this assumes you can type from home row reliably on
your keyboard of choice.
