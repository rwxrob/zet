# Don't live stream confidential phone conversations

AI can read lips now. Make sure you are off screen completely.

This significantly reduces the value of a coworking live stream where I'm doing actual work with audio turned off. Now I have to turn my camera off or move off screen leaving only chat and music for the community. Some still like that because they can chat during the day, but it really changes the voyeur attraction of coworking streams.
