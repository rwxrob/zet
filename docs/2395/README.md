# Quitting remote outdoor IRL streaming away from car

I've decided to drop both ATT plans and one of Verizon data plans for outdoor IRL streaming and replace them eventually with Starlink Mobility service. I'll keep one Verizon 100GB/month data plan as a backup and for relatively strong-signal IRL streaming on occasion.

## Starlink enables hassle-free wild camping

Starlink works *anywhere* that isn't covered. This means I can take full advantage of all the free BLM land camping locations anywhere in America. And, at this point, I want to visit every single one of them. Wild camping is so much easier and hassle-free than attempting to camp in another area.

## Better to stay near car

As I pondered what type of remote life I want to pursue, the idea of "wild camping" kept popping up. All that people who do wild camping are my kinda people. Those who bounce around to different RV and camp locations are a different crowd entirely, good people, just not the kind of people I would prefer to meet compared to those who camp "in the wild".

But, in the wild means that all the stuff in the car could just be stolen at any time without anyone even noticing. Going too far away from the car in the wild is also dangerous if I fall or break something. There are ways to do that safely carrying different devices with you (assuming you are conscious to use them). But the default during most of the day is going to be living right next to the car under the Yakima awning or in the "living room" working away.

The need to venture away from the car also diminishes in the wild. There's no need to have a beautiful destination to bike *to* when I'm already there.

## Prefer to make videos instead of live stream

TerryB stopped live streaming for all the reasons that I now fully agree with. Many of them he didn't spell out directly, but it is pretty obvious he has a certain standard for the video content that has his name on it, and a shitty, low-bitrate live stream is not something worth the money for him. He's in it for the money (action videos are his job) and there is more money to be had with well-crafted video content than with absolutely random live streams.

I still plan on live streaming, just not in the universal way that I have been (like a Robcdee or JayStreezy). In fact, you can see these IRL streamers that do it for a living seriously struggling to make ends meet and maintain that schedule of daily streaming. I plan on creating a lot more short-form outdoor IRL content for Instagram and YouTube, and one highly crafted video every two weeks as I change locations. Then I can talk about the upcoming video or the last released video in a live stream. With YouTube I can also be in the chat for the premiere.

## Twitch is cracking down on simulcasting

Twitch specifically says they are going to go after people who are using technology to link the chats during a simulcast even though they are going to allow simulcasting now. This is just absolutely stupid. In fact, it almost makes me want to get off of Twitch. The *only* thing Twitch
