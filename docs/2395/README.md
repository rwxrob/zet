# Quitting remote outdoor IRL streaming away from car

I've decided to drop both ATT plans and one of Verizon data plans for outdoor IRL streaming and replace them eventually with a Starlink Mobility service. I'll keep one Verizon 100GB/month data plan as a backup and for relatively strong-signal IRL streaming on occasion.

## Starlink provides more for less

The Starlink Land Mobility package is 250/month, which is almost exactly what I pay for two Verizon and two ATT accounts now. Starlink provides unlimited 40-220 MBPS download and 8-25 MBPS upload, which *blows away* anything that is possible from any service provider in the United States. The signal is also *always* available from any geographical location on planet Earth that can "see" the sky. I understand now why Verizon is worried. Starlink mobile is changing the entire ecosystem of data service providers.

ATT is just an accident waiting to happen. I once paid 450 dollars in overage charges. I can just to pay-as-you-go prepaid when and if ever needed again. I already spent the money on the modems themselves.

## Enables streaming from a moving car

The new Mobility offering allows streaming from my car, anywhere. I can even do it from my laptop mounted where my passenger-side front seat used to be (after I remove it).

## Enables hassle-free wild camping

Starlink works *anywhere* that isn't covered. This means I can take full advantage of all the free BLM land camping locations anywhere in America. And, at this point, I want to visit every single one of them. Wild camping is so much easier and hassle-free than attempting to camp in another area.

## Better to stay near car

As I pondered what type of remote life I want to pursue, the idea of "wild camping" kept popping up. All that people who do wild camping are my kinda people. Those who bounce around to different RV and camp locations are a different crowd entirely, good people, just not the kind of people I would prefer to meet compared to those who camp "in the wild".

But, in the wild means that all the stuff in the car could just be stolen at any time without anyone even noticing. Going too far away from the car in the wild is also dangerous if I fall or break something. There are ways to do that safely carrying different devices with you (assuming you are conscious to use them). But the default during most of the day is going to be living right next to the car under the Yakima awning or in the "living room" working away.

The need to venture away from the car also diminishes in the wild. There's no need to have a beautiful destination to bike *to* when I'm already there.
