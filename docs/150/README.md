# Need TFTP Linux Server at Home

I really want to run Kubernetes on bare-metal, but I don't want to
hassle with reconfiguring all the servers every time (the reason that
most people use virtual machines instead, but at a 30% performance
penalty). I think being able to boot a server and have it grab it's
entire configuration from a network boot is something to (re)consider
these days. I've talked to veteran technologists and architects who
agree.
