# ZettelSearch Specification (`zet find`)

The ZettelSearch specification allows people to implement a consistent
search engine of their own (however they wish) that contains the same
basic structure and scope. The priority is on the *user* (not the author
or hosting provider) setting their own search parameters and maintaining
full control of how and when their searches are made. To understand this
specification it is first required to understand the Zettel Data
Model.
