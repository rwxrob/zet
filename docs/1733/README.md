Depends on how much money you need and when you need it. Find something to pay the bills to relieve the pressure.

* OvertheWire.org
* PicoCTF.org
* HackTheBox.com
* TryHackMe.com
* HackerOne.com

Learn Linux and PowerShell on your own.

Don't rule out WGU CyberSecurity.

If you have money, find a *good* mentor and offer to pay them 50-70/hour to guide your learning (not *teach* you).

Learn about all operating systems.
