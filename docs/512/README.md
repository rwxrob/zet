# "Updation" is Not a Fucking Word

I'm so tired hearing native English speakers use this dumb-ass word. I
thought for a second maybe I had it wrong, that it sneaked into our
normal words (like "snuck" has). But now, it's not a fucking word. Stop
using it.

By the way, I read it in the official Tekton GitHub repositories.
