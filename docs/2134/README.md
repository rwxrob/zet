# Why get Wahoo KICKR Bike over Zwift Hub?

The Zwift Hub is the best entry level Zwift experience but many people will quickly hit its limitations (as I have):

* +/- 2.5% accuracy (Garmin and KICKR Bike are +/- 1%).
* Bluetooth or ANT+ failures at occasional but critical times.
* Imperfect resistance from budget breaking of drive train.
* Daily annoyance or connecting and disconnecting bike to indoor trainer.
* Lack of steering or elevation tilting.
* 10x slower latency for racing and virtual ride feel.
* Bicycle required along with more bicycle maintenance.
* Loss of power through drive train.

At a 500 dollar price tag these are minimal concerns for most Zwift riders---especially beginners. But for those who have decided to dedicate themselves to becoming competitive Zwift racers and or serious indoor riders to the point where they would invest the same amount of money as for an outdoor entry-level race or climbing bike the Wahoo KICKR Bike is the obvious choice despite it's 4000 dollar price tag (which is still 2000 dollar cheaper than a Specialized Aethos Comp, the low-end one).

The current version of Wahoo KICKR Bike now has "race mode" that works over directly connected Ethernet (or optional wifi) making it rock solid reliable. And since Zwift now has full support for directly network connected smart devices having one that supports direct connect over wired Ethernet will quickly become the high-performance indoor racing standard. With Zwift cycling being accepted as the first Olympic Esport it is clear Wahoo and Zwift are laser-focused on the *serious* indoor cycling crowd, and with good reason. Most of us in this category are well-established, have families that can share a SmartBike, and still have a competitive fire in us well past our 40s. Just imagine the positive, well-earned hype Wahoo and Zwift will get at the next Olympic E-sports event where *real* indoor cycling is show-cased for the world. Personally, I think this makes the additional price justifiable. Zwift and Wahoo are now perfectly prepared to require SmartBike registration and weigh-ins for events with actual prize money. It's a very exciting time to get into indoor endurance sports.
