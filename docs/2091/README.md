# Giro Vanquish bike helmet *NOT* better than Aether

As soon as I learned about the Giro Vanquish aero helmet with a full, replaceable visor that can be worn with prescription glasses under it I wanted one but ended up returning it immediately. 

* The visor easily falls off and doesn't stow well.
* It doesn't deal with sweat nearly as well.
* It looks really stupid, like that Malcolm in the Middle episode.
* Doesn't work well with sunglasses (visor is required).

The Aether is so much better, when a helmet is required.
