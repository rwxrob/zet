# Why most cycling indoors on Zwift?

Outdoor cycling in Mooresville, North Carolina, 'Merica is just not sustainable on a daily level.

***Safer.*** Living in Race City USA is hella dangerous for a cyclist. I've stopped counting how many times I've almost been hit, and not in a little way. Even being in a car in this shitty hell hole is fucking dangerous. I don't want to promote all this health only to die like the woman who was hit and killed just last month on her bike fully within her legal rights on a relatively safe road. Add the complication of live-streaming and you have a recipe for eventually tragedy.

***Calmer.*** Because of everything in the last paragraph, cycling outdoors is far more stressful. I end up switching from an amazing mental state to wanting to kill someone. This happens less indoors where the only thing I want to kill is my computer that keeps messing up my screen or something.

***Private.*** I do what I want, when I want. I don't have to deal with people not wanting the camera in their neighborhood. I have been stopped more than once by people in a suburb wanting to know what I was doing.

***Easier.*** It is just setup. I sit, pick a workout, and go.

***Effective.*** Consistent workouts with accurate measurements of health. Outside measurements are just plain wrong (especially calories burned).

***Cheaper.*** While not cheap, the overall maintainability costs much less.

***Funner.*** Gamification is a thing.

***Communal.*** Zwift allows getting into Discord and riding virtually with friends from all over the globe. I look forward to getting good enough to organize rides with friends from my Twitch community.

Leaves *intentional* cycling for outdoors (traveling to a location).
