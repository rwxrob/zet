# Considering return to document-oriented content organization

While the Zettelkasten method has been great for saving information I need to retrieve quickly and remember there is still a need to have *consumable* content derived from it. Turns out humans have figured this out already. It's also the basis of HTML and the Web. The humble "document" model is where it is at. In fact, if you combine the experience of publications like Reader's Digest and modern blog publishing the perfect length for an "article" is the amount of time it takes to take a shit. Anything longer and the reading gets spread over two trips to the bathroom.

Now that you have that image burned into your memory, imagine the length of such a document. For most it will be about 800 words. That's not a lot. It means I'll have to focus on the single main idea (like with a single zettel) but have room to flesh out the prose with easy to read and mnemonically significant prose. I'll also create a single, memorable tag that is the name of the document (generally with no dashes) so that people can get to it immediately from the root of the site. Putting that all in Mkdocs should allow it to be easily searched.
