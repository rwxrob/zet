# WebSocket server plugin included in OBS 28+!

> "obs-websocket is now included by default with OBS Studio 28.0.0 and above."

OMG, I'm so happy about this. OBS is such amazing software. So much can be controlled with it and the plugin architecture is rock solid. Now that WebSocket interface has been added by default (which allows control of just about everything over the network) there is almost nothing you *can't* do with it.
