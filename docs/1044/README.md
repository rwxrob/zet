# Bullshit Career Sites Fuck You Up

I have to rant about this because it makes everyone else's job harder.
This [shitty site] says that a "Full Stack Engineer" is "responsible for
developing and implementing software programs for a company." Nothing
could be farther from the truth. Any beginner reading this would
be really confused. What this lazy site is trying to describe is "Full
Stack Developer," which is an entirely different thing. Stuff like this
is super annoying to someone like me trying to help people navigate
their way through all the terminology and reality. But people like me
are drowned out by all the uninformed, lazy no-research, bullshit that
we never get a chance to even describe to beginners why they are being
misled. If you were asked, "How would you describe the daily work of a
Full-Stack Engineer?" in a job interview and told them this you would
likely fail the interview just for being that fucking clueless.
