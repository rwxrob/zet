# Should I Support Multi-Paragraph List Items?

I always come back to what Medium (the blogging platform) enforces. It
has worked out very well for them. Not only do they not allow
multi-level bulleted lists, but they also don't allow list items to have
line returns in them.

The Godoc format is also focused very intensely on words and
communication and less on formatting. I want to keep that strong
emphasis on clarity over "rich" anything.

So the answer is no, no multi-paragraph list items, no lists of any kind
that are more than one level deep.

These simplifications will not only make the content easier to read and
write in source form, but will make it the fastest possible written
source format to parse, which is a very critical need for KEG since
parsing is happening all over the place --- especially by client
readers.
