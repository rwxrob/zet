# Distributed code book approach to projects and learning

* Create a new GitHub repo (or some other distributed Git service)
* Pull repo to laptop or local system with read/write
* Pull repo to systems working on with read only
* Make incremental changes to read-only repo to get to work
* Copy changes manually to reinforce learning into main repo
* Git stash changes in read-only repo
* Git pull changes back from main repo
* Confirm everything works reinforcing new knowledge of what was done
