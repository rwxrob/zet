# Three hour maximum

Intensity over endurance, for anyone over 50 that's the key to longevity without sacrificing too much fun. By capping my break-through training sessions to three hours I force myself to focus on intensity instead of ultra-endurance.

After yesterday's long indoor ride that started out as an attempt to ride for seven hours straight (about a century in miles) and bonking after four hours I discovered that I need to adjust my carb intake but, more importantly, I realized I never really want or need to ride longer than three hours. Further investigation into the health needs of older cyclists confirms that the best focus for my health is on intensity and building muscle over ultra-endurance, being faster over short, tough distances. Being able to average 40 kph for three hours on rolling hills is a far better health goal than 22 kph for seven hours.

The Lake Norman Gran Fondo is my perfect race, at 75 miles with first place going to a old-guy coming in just under three hours it is a very attainable goal. In fact, several three-hour finishers were in their 60s.

I will still attempt Assault on Mt. Mitchell this year. I did pay 250 dollars or more to even do it. But I'm not as focused on preparing for that race as much as I am the LNGF. In other words, I'm not going to care how long Mt. Mitchell takes, or even if I finish in any decent time because that is no longer my high-performance goal. Instead, I want to be on the podium in August with other old guys. That decision took some thought. I was considering lengthening my training rides to best prepare me for the long-haul that is Mt. Mitchell, but training for a seven hour slog versus a three-hour tempo race is radically different. Plus I just enjoy training for the shorter tempo length more because it is so much more fun on group rides both indoor and out.

This also gives me back a bunch of time. I no longer need to plan long-slow, 7-hour centuries on the weekends. Instead, I can just really up the pace and intensity on the metric century rides (about three hours at tempo). Having that time back is good because there are other goals unrelated to training that I want to start addressing.

Let's be honest, "ultra" is synonymous with "tolerance for suffering" more than actual endurance ability.
Anything over three hours becomes more about one's ability to live with saddle-sores, blisters, sunburn, and extreme discomfort, to override and ignore the natural signal to your brain that you are hurting youself.  All that ultra stuff has very real risk of [damaging a person's body beyond repair](https://youtu.be/AY4RN_82TpY?si=BdwVphmS3gc-97UQ&t=538) and has been proven (citing Atia) to reduce overall longevity. No thank you.
