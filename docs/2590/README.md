# Difference between "adventure by bike" and "digital nomad by bike"

As I was packing I realized there is a significant distinction between most adventure cyclists and digital nomads living by bike. Unlike an adventure cyclist who seeks adventure while getting away from it all, a DNB seeks a sustainable, regular work life while traveling to new destinations every day. Life itself is the adventure for a DNB. Every day is a challenge to keep mind, body, work, and bike in balance.

* Less total weekly time on a bike
* Much slower pace
* Only 2-days away from civilization and an AC power outlet
* Heavily loaded with nomadic office gear
* Less able to tolerate risk of any kind

## Less time on the bike

I target three hours on the bike per day maximum. There just isn't more time than that if I want to work on honest 40-hour work week. This is the same amount of time I used to spend when biking from my home after a work day (or before) and that was very hard to fit into the day.

Most cyclists will agree that even fitting two hours into *every single day* is a rather high training volume. When thinking about it in terms of just cyclist physical training, that's a 21 hour week. If that training were focused it would be enough to train for elite amateur (cat 1) status. Even if every single ride is in zone 2 (which is rare pulling a 70 lbs trailer) the TSS on that kind of volume is *very* high. Plus I'm old.

Less time on the bike also means things like aero-bars to give an additional comfort position just aren't needed. If the daily ride is the same that I would do from home training for an ultra-distance event then I just don't need them (even though if I were training for such an event I would use them because such events don't involve towing a trailer).

## DNBs bike much more slowly

It's virtually impossible to live as a DNB without a 70 lbs trailer with a Starlink and the battery to go with it (along with two hotspots as backup when/if the Starlink fails). This requires a much slower pace. For me 13 mph (21 kph) is my max. This depends on everyone's fitness as well.

It is worth mentioning that the official limit on the Burley COHO XC fully loaded is 20 mph and a Roam Starlink account is (technically) limited to 10 mph (but testing proves it works at 80 mph as well).

## DNBs are more risk-averse

DNBs push their boundaries with much more caution because if something goes wrong they don't get paid---or worse---might be forced to stop DNB living.
