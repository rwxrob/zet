ðŸ”¥ Parsing Expression Grammar Notation (PEGN) is a language that I created for expressing *any* grammar in a way that is easy to parse cognitively and programmatically without any specific application or implementation in mind. It improves regular expressions and builds on the best of existing meta and data structure languages such as PEG, ABNF, EBNF, and JSON.

PEGN is strongly inspired by Bryan Ford's paper and PEG example.

PEGN can be transcribed to Go Ratex directly, and vice-versa.
