# Blogging from a mobile phone is idiotic

I don't know how I became so stupid over all that "digital nomad by bike" stuff. I was so desperate to still be able to do basic things like update a knowledge base that I started using Wordpress.com only because it could be edited by speaking into a web page and using my mobile phone to generate content. But the type of content a person can blog from a phone is ridiculously bad. It's always better to make an Instagram post with a big of text and several photos. If and when you want to create long-form content then create a proper blog post from a computer with a keyboard or, if not ready for publishing, ssh into your zettelkasten and update it there. I don't mind calling myself out for that stupidity. Hopefully, it will help someone else avoid the same mistake.
