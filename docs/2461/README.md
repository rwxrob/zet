# 2024-2030 life goals and long-term plan

*I threw in an extra year into the 5-year plan, but this will make it easier to find later.*

Looking back on 2021 5-year plan been amazed at how much of it we accomplished. Both Doris and I have done amazing things mostly because we set out to do them as high priorities (usually at the cost of other ones). Well, time to do it again.

## I just want to ride

I'm happiest when I'm riding my bike safely in places that are visually interesting and provide a challenge. Now that I've remembered this fact about myself, after forgetting and floundering around until I rediscovered it, the rest of my life goals are pretty much based around it. It's not even people, travel, culture, and art that interest me. It's biking in the open air.

## I actually hate people

If I'm *brutality* honest, I actually *hate* people. People *mostly* suck. People are the reason I'm grumpy and pissed off most of the time. I'm a lot like George Carlin in that respect. He gave up on humanity in the most optomistic nihlist way possible. He had lost all hope but somehow kept his happiness and ability to make jokes about how horrible everything is. That's pretty much me. I am super picky about those I would seek out to be my friends and am never really anxious to make new ones. Ironically, I'm not really an introvert either.

## SKILSTAK is done (for next five years or so)

Notice there is nothing in these goals about SKILSTAK. SKILSTAK is done (at least for the next five years). No more Boost. No books. Perhaps as I get older my thinking on that will change 

## Live streaming continues but random

I'm only streaming stuff I *want* to make and do. If someone else benefits so much the better.
I will still likely stream technical things that I'm interested in or working.

## No desire to go back to Carribean after all

As much as I love Barbados and Martinique, those islands are impossibly dangerous to get around on by bicycle---even more dangerous than the US.
