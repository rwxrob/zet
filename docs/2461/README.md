# 2024-2030 life goals and long-term plan

*I threw in an extra year into the 5-year plan, but this will make it easier to find later.*

Looking back on 2021 5-year plan been amazed at how much of it we accomplished. Both Doris and I have done amazing things mostly because we set out to do them as high priorities (usually at the cost of other ones). Well, time to do it again.

## SKILSTAK is done (for next five years or so)

Notice there is nothing in these goals about SKILSTAK. SKILSTAK is done (at least for the next five years). No more Boost. No books. Perhaps as I get older my thinking on that will change 

## Live streaming continues but random

I'm only streaming stuff I *want* to make and do. If someone else benefits so much the better.
I will still likely stream technical things that I'm interested in or working.
