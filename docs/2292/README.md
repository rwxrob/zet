# No more alcohol for a while

Just read another thing in National Geographic that claimed alcohol *always* messes up sleep and recovery, because it is literally a poison solvent. I had one beer and a glass of wine yesterday and it really messed up my sleep schedule---and more importantly---fucked with my recovery. I'm going to give it all a break.

To take its place, I'll allow myself "cozy" foods like ice cream and the occasional burger or whatever (which cost half the price usually).
