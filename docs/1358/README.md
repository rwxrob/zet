# Gnome-Terminal Cannot Disable Bold Font

You get the proper color (`01;32`) but also get the fat letters (which
frankly no one actually likes). Apparently, this is the reason the new
Microsoft terminal does not do bold fonts (at least not by default) but
it does recognized the different color for them. Solarized popularized
the use of "bold" as indicating a completely different color rather than
just making them actually bold. So there is some discrepancy within
terminal application teams as to how to handle them. Obviously, the
pedantic Gnome team said, "Hell no, bold is bold" while the MS team
said, "It just looks better." This is one of the few cases where I
*really* agree with Microsoft. I hate that I cannot disable bold on
PopOS! (an Ubuntu derivative). Alacritty can do this, but it gets so
many other things wrong at this point it's just not worth it. I really
tried to make it work.
