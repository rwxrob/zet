# Get the BEST Job, Not Just *Any* Job

Recently, I've been reminded that my focus has always been first)
empowering people with technology, and second) helping people learn the
skills to get *the* job, not just any job, the *best* job they can can
get (that they wish). 

When I joke about web development (like Linus Torvaldz) not even being
"development" at all --- let alone "engineering" --- it's backed by the
fact that I started in web development and continued to move into more
substantial operations and *actual* software engineering roles. It's not
that I'm putting down all the people who do web design for a living,
it's more that so many of them are content to not reach any further, to
remain one-trick ponies forever even though they are capable of so much
more. The world *needs* more! Hence, "learn code, save the world."

What comes off as "asshole" to some, is actually me placing greater
expectations on those I work with because I know most of them can do
much better than web development as a career, in fact, pretty much all
of them.

I'm not content helping people do just the minimum to get the job
(unless they are literally starving and unemployed). I'm focused on
their future, on building a solid base that will provide a technical
foundation that will underpin everything they ever do from that
moment on. 

Like Mr. Miyagi teaching "wax on, wax off" to a naive Daniel-son who had
to be rudely shown the reason why these mundane repetitions were
required for his muscle memory, I focus first and foremost on the
essentials, like terminal and bash scripting skills. No one gets a job
*just* for these skills just like no rock star or concert pianist
becomes known for their incredible ability to play scales with relaxed
fingers in the proper position. 

I prepare virtuosos, not buskers obsessed with polite mediocrity.
