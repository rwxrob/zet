This morning I'm all fired up. Being old does a lot of things to a person. One of them is realizing all the ways people have fucked you over your entire life. In fact, there is actually a class-action lawsuit against the Mormons by thousands of people trying to get their 10% tithing back for being defrauded out of it (which I love).

Rather than be a prick like Mark Andressen, who I remember when he put up a simple HTML web page in 94 with just a bunch of links on it and called is Yahoo, before he paywalled it, I took another route because from the time I encountered Linux I was all about fucking "free software." Here's the thing. I was DEAD WRONG!

The entire free software movement is absolutely full of shit and has seriously hurt a lot of people in the world. Do you see Doctors being asked how they use their free time to "give back" to their communities during job interviews? Nope. The "open" part of "open source" was good to get bigger companies to invest in things without losing their investment, so that was good. But the "free" part of free software has always been absolute shit. Turns out the saying, "There is nothing in this world that comes for free," is actually true.

* Beginner Boost "supporters" are full of shit (for the most part)
* Beginner Boost as a free livestreamed session is officially dead
* People always want something for free without giving anything back
* People are happy to say "thank you" for getting them huge-paying jobs (but nothing more)
* Schools are happy to use my stuff for their curriculums without even acknowledging it
* Somehow I'm the bad guy for not dropping everything and helping people find jobs
* I have been plagiarised my entire fucking life (Teleport, Nike, etc.)
* People are too fucking lazy and cheap to even watch YouTube and Twitch ads
* Content creators don't get a fucking dime when ad-blockers stop the ads
* Content creators are demonized for wanting to be paid for their time and work
* Content creators have been cancelled by Twitch just for creating "subscriber only" content
* No more free rides for free-loaders who cannot even put up with an ad
* Time spent on Beginner Boost will be put into paywalled web site with *premium* content
* Writing one highly polished article with screenshots and asciicinema per week
* Will be adding YouTube shorts to go with and promote paywalled weekly article
* YouTube shorts will be free but with advertising
* Will livestream (free) to Twitch while creating the content and videos (no vods)
* Will livestream bike rides on Twitch for free to answer questions, etc.
* Will leave up old YouTube content for those who don't care about latest
* At Doris' recommendation, will apply for grants for those who cannot afford
* Will decide, myself, who gets the grant money based on application
* People will be *pissed off* that I'm doing this. I don't fucking care.
* Being nice has *fucked me over my entire life.*

Let's see how long this topic lasts before it shows up in another YouTuber/Twitch streamer's live streams without any acknowledgement, again. I am so fucking tired of YouTubers directly ripping my topics for their own huge audiences and not even changing a lot of the talking points.
