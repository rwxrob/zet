* Beginner Boost "supporters" are full of shit (for the most part)
* Beginner Boost as a free livestreamed session is officially dead
* People always want something for free without giving anything back
* People are happy to say "thank you" for getting them huge-paying jobs (but nothing more)
* Schools are happy to use my stuff for their curriculums without even acknowledging it
* I have be plagiarized my entire fucking life (Teleport, Nike, etc.)
* People are too fucking lazy and cheap to even watch YouTube and Twitch ads
* Content creators don't get a fucking dime when ad-blockers stop the ads
* Content creators wanting to be paid for their time and work are demonized
* No more free rides for free-loaders who cannot even put up with an ad.
* Time spent on Beginner Boost will be put into paywalled web site with *premium* content
* Writing one highly polished article with screenshots and asciicinema per week
* Will be adding YouTube shorts to go with and promote paywalled weekly article
* YouTube shorts will be free but with advertising
* Will livestream (free) to Twitch while creating the content and videos (no vods)
* Will livestream bike rides on Twitch for free to answer questions, etc.
* Will leave up old YouTube content for those who don't care about latest
* At Doris' recommendation, will apply for grants for those who cannot afford
* Will decide, myself, who gets the grant money based on application
* People will be *pissed off* that I'm doing this. I don't fucking care.
* Being nice has *fucked me over my entire life.*
