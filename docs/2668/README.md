This morning I'm all fired up. Being old does a lot of things to a person. One of them is realizing all the ways people have fucked you over your entire life. In fact, there is actually a class-action lawsuit against the Mormons by thousands of people trying to get their 10% tithing back for being defrauded out of it (which I love).

Rather than be a prick like Mark Andressen, who I remember when he put up a simple HTML web page in 94 with just a bunch of links on it and called is Yahoo, before he paywalled it, I took another route because from the time I encountered Linux I was all about fucking "free software." Here's the thing. I was DEAD WRONG!

The entire free software movement is absolutely full of shit and has seriously hurt a lot of people in the world. Do you see Doctors being asked how they use their free time to "give back" to their communities during job interviews? Nope. The "open" part of "open source" was good to get bigger companies to invest in things without losing their investment, so that was good. But the "free" part of free software has always been absolute shit. Turns out the saying, "There is nothing in this world that comes for free," is actually true.

* Beginner Boost "supporters" are full of shit (for the most part)
* Beginner Boost as a free livestreamed session is officially dead
* People always want something for free without giving anything back
* People are happy to say "thank you" for getting them huge-paying jobs (but nothing more)
* Schools are happy to use my stuff for their curriculums without even acknowledging it
* Somehow I'm the bad guy for not dropping everything and helping people find jobs
* I have been plagiarised my entire fucking life (Teleport, Nike, etc.)
* People are too fucking lazy and cheap to even watch YouTube and Twitch ads
* Content creators don't get a fucking dime when ad-blockers stop the ads
* Content creators are demonized for wanting to be paid for their time and work
* Content creators have been cancelled by Twitch just for creating "subscriber only" content
* No more free rides for free-loaders who cannot even put up with an ad
* Time spent on Beginner Boost will be put into paywalled web site with *premium* content
* Writing one highly polished article with screenshots and asciicinema per week
* Will be adding YouTube shorts to go with and promote paywalled weekly article
* YouTube shorts will be free but with advertising
* Will livestream (free) to Twitch while creating the content and videos (no vods)
* Will livestream bike rides on Twitch for free to answer questions, etc.
* Will leave up old YouTube content for those who don't care about latest
* At Doris' recommendation, will apply for grants for those who cannot afford
* Will decide, myself, who gets the grant money based on application
* People will be *pissed off* that I'm doing this. I don't fucking care.
* Being nice has *fucked me over my entire life.*

Let's see how long this topic lasts before it shows up in another YouTuber/Twitch streamer's live streams without any acknowledgement, again. I am so fucking tired of YouTubers directly ripping my topics for their own huge audiences and not even changing a lot of the talking points.

## Can I successfully create content live?

Perhaps the biggest decision yet to be made is should I live stream the creation of the premium content that is behind the paywall. There are lots of considerations here:

**Does livestreaming content creation compromise the content by giving it away?**

I don't think so because that's the same idea behind the YouTube short. The topic is open season and will likely promote the discussion of that same topic by others in the content creation community, but this is how the community works. Knowing what the topic is and talking about it from an original perspective is one thing, copying all the conclusions and talking points from the content itself is another.

**What about VODs?**

While another content creator could watch a three hour video of me creating a few YouTube shorts and a single related article for the web, that's a lot of work. But if I make the VOD available someone intent on summarizing and stealing my content could just fast-forward or put the VOD through some sort of speech-to-text filter. (Believe me, it's been done, people have even *asked* to do it and then republish the VODs on their own YouTube channels without even thinking about why that is a just a shitty thing to ask.)

Another thing about VODs, they usually have copyrighted music in them and eventually will get dinged by someone, somehow. If I had no other reason to disable VODs that would be it. This also allows me to stream content IRL from the bike while playing music. So what if it blocks clips. I can just mark the stream and go back and create really good clips on my own terms later. That also keeps me from having to control what clips get made. Often I don't agree with a clip or three copies of the clip get created and I'm a demon for deleting someone's "hard work" to create the redundant copy. Better I just control all of that.

Disabling VODSs also encourages more people to be present for each stream meaning I might actually finally reach more than 70 simultaneous viewers in order to qualify for partner (although that has never really been a big goal). Besides, I would rather people watch and promote the saved videos on YouTube much more than Twitch VODs.

**Going to create a lurker report**

For my own sanity, I'm going to create a cronjob that regularly downloads and populates a list of everyone who has been watching my stream and associate it with the stream. Then I'll have a nice pretty way to see *everyone* who is my actual demographic. Hell, I might even publish that code for free so other streamers can hone in on people stealing their content and ideas.

Being able to see a report of how much each person in my stream spends watching it also has the direct value of allowing me to truly identify my biggest community members, not from some stupid streamlabs bot. Then I'll simply know if and when I find another streamer spending a large amount of time watching my live streams when they suddenly seem to start talking about exactly the same things, even using my own quotes without acknowledging that I said them (like a late night host ripping another's monologue act, I know it sounds crazy, but I've seen it twice now).

In fact, I could even publish the total amount of time people are spending in my stream by VOD with a "biggest fans" page that can be drilled down by day. This is not doxing anything that isn't already public information. If people want anonymity they can create a second Twitch account. Hell, I could (but won't) even associate the total number of bits and subs and donations from those people. At a minimum I will show whether they are subbed or not. Some of the highest volume watchers don't even fucking sub to show support and get pissy when I give them shit about it. No more. Some even make jokes about the thousands of dollars I have invested in getting the IRL streaming stuff completely polished and figured out just so they don't have to pay anything and then complain because I haven't "documented" it all for their free-loading ass who can't even afford a subscription. Meanwhile, absolutely shitty "courses" in IRL streaming on Udemy continue to make money even though they are horribly and absolutely wrong.

**Yes.**

I think the answer is just yes. With the lurker report in place I'll be able to see when people are abusing me and call them out on it (if I feel like it).
