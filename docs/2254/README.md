# How much IRL streaming can I actually do?

I got burned by a 400 bill from ATT overages in March. I'll never let that happen again. I made the mistake of assuming I had the same capping for ATT that I have for Verizon (which cuts you to a trickle without charging you, no just option exists for ATT, bastards). ATT is an essential component because there are many times that only ATT modem service works and both Verizon modems do not. Other times it is the reverse. So I have to keep ATT no matter how much I hate it. And since "unlimited" bandwidth simply does not exist in the USofA I'm fucked. Best I can do it be absolutely sure where I stand on bandwidth all the time. Suffice it to say, this has put a real cramp in my IRL streaming schedule. I'm trying to get around that.

* Turned on limitation warning on my ATT modem itself as rough warning.
* Calculated that I have about 40 hours a month to stream with bandwidth equally dispersed.
* That's roughly 10 hours of IRL streaming per week.
* (None of these limitations apply when streaming over wifi.)
* Make best use of IRL streams (no more meh content, make sure engaging).

It sucks because I have a lot more Verizon bandwidth but I cannot control how much bandwidth goes through each modem (even though typically that is something I could code in Belabox if rationalIRL hadn't been a complete dick and closed-sourced all of it).

One thing I need to get better at doing is using the local wifi of the places I visit, like the McColl center. In such cases I can disable the wifi dongle for ATT and replace it with one that connects to free wifi. It's the only one I have to watch.

All of this hassle makes it a frustrating just enough to simply stop me from IRL streaming. I have other things to do rather than futz around with all the logistics.
