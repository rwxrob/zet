# ðŸ“ž What do you think of NC power stations shot up?

I fucking hate it. It just reminds me that at the end of the day humans are just animals like any others subject to the same irrational fears, imaginations, and violence when threatened. We are greedy as fuck, because nature rewards the greedy. We really don't care about each other, mostly we care about how others view us. There's no such thing as altruism (except maybe between mother and child). It's all just about self-interest brought about from evolutionary pressure that we can't even begin to understand, but need to in order to progress without destroying ourselves. Perhaps, if we understand how delusional and dangerous so many humans are we can progress and save ourselves from them. And no, I don't believe any angry white dude in the sky would ever condone the shit these angry people did.
