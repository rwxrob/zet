# Change Spotify defaults on phone

So I bought some Meze 99 Classics cans, best headphones I have ever had. They completely satisfy my ultra-demanding requirement for good music audio and they can be detached cleanly from their connecting head rest/band so that I can put a wide headband around my head and hold them in place even though I have a cycling helmet on. When I plugged them into Spotify on my phone I realized something was seriously wrong. Also, I had been judging a *ton* of headphones to find the right ones wrongly. When I opened Spotify settings I was blown away at how screwed up they were. Most are defaults, I think. I changed them to the following and things have been bliss ever since:

* "Mono Audio" (I *did not* set this ever, but discovered it was on)
* "Save Data" off (forces bad audio quality)
* "Canvas" off (who cares)
* "Audio Quality" set to "Very High" (for everything)
* "Auto adjust quality" off
* "Download" set to "Normal"
* "Equalizer" set to 80% bass boost and full surround
