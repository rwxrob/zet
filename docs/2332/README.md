# Streaming changes on rwxrob.tv: multistreaming, more coding

Fall seems to be the season for broad changes to everything I have been doing since the last year. Here's everything planned so far.

## Daily outdoor IRL (culture journalism)

* 3-5 hours of outdoor IRL per day

Recently I was reminded that I've *never* wanted to be a technologist as a profession. I sort of fell into it because of the financial needs of raising a family.

The fact is I've *always* wanted to be a journalist and writer. It's the reason I majored in French and Russian. It's why I became a cruise director, river guide, and mountain bike guide. I've been exploring my whole life and supporting myself (and my family) has always been my dream. I'm obsessed with people, understanding why and how they work, what drives them, and where there creativity comes from---especially musicians.

Ever since I started cycling slowly---with the intend to explore and discover---I've been having amazing experiences getting randomly embedded in all kinds of events and situations.

I don't want that to stop.

In fact, I want that to take over my tech job at some point. I'll keep my tech skills, but only so I can keep maintaining my own systems and stuff and pay the bills when things get tight.

## Adding back dedicated "learn to code" weekly

* Most of my community is still into tech---especially coding.
* Prefer to focus on getting beginners started right.
* "Hand holding" to do it with them seems most popular.
* Optional "assignments" (but no evaluation).
* Autodidactic focus, lots of just-in-time learning and research.
* Keep project-based (command line tools, microservices, hacking).
* Shell (POSIX/bash) for `make` replacements (`build`, `run`).
* Go for command-line tools and microservices.
* Python for configuration management, data-focused applications and AI model creation.
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript basics to implement static site generator.
* GCP someplace.

## Streaming to multiple platforms

* Streaming to Kick, YouTube, Facebook, Twitch, Twitter.
* I have family on Facebook.
* There are people who cannot use Twitch.
* Kick gives higher percentages.
* Twitch continues to fuck over content creators.
* I will probably drop Twitter if Instagram streaming becomes option.

## Cranking up ads on Twitch

* The more ads, the more likely Twitch will push your stream.
* There are a lot of other options for people if they don't like ads.
