# Use Nimbus Screenshot instead of Windows Snip

The built-in Microsoft snipping tool --- even the new and improved one --- is all kinds of horrible. The most annoying thing about it is that it doesn't even create files in a predictable and definable location, just clipboard entries that are buried in some temp directory. Nimbus runs as a Chrome extension and allows all kinds of editing options and such. When combined with a shared folder between Windows and Linux Samba mount it makes it easy to add images to zettelkasten keg content nodes.
