# What should IRL streamer call oneself to avoid confusion?

When approaching a complete stranger, often in their place of business, with an IRL rig it is crucial to inform them as fast as possible about what you are doing to assuage any concerns they might have and discover the few people who are absolutely, positively never going to be okay with a camera in their face or anyone else's, which is perfect fine for them to want. The most important thing to prepare, therefore, is how to introduce oneself, including a title that will be familiar to the person. Here are the titles I've tried:

* Culture streamer
* Culture journalist
* Twitch streamer
* Video blogger
* Videographer

So far "video blogger" seems to be the most effective for the most people. I've never tried "vlogger" but I think that is too hard to have them hear correctly. I think most humans alive today know what "blogging" is at this point and adding "video" to it makes them understand quickly. "Blogging" has come to mean "journalism for the common person" to most, which seems to be more positive than "journalist" which has been associated with "fake news" these days.

Ironically, streamer is not understood by *a lot* of people unless the crowd is *really* young. Then telling them they are on Twitch brings out their inner performer usually.
