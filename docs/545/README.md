# I Applied for Twitch Partner Today

I applied for Twitch Partner today (November 14, 2021), 22 months after
my first stream. I do hope I have what it takes to show Twitch that this
community is worthy of transcoding and the visibility that comes from a
partnership. I realize I really need the transcoding now that I will be
doing more IRL streams and pushing them at 1080 with 30 fps.

I was very serious in my application about possibly organizing a meetup
at the next Twitch Con and hosting a forum about education and personal
improvement. 

I still need to update my About page to represent the "variety" nature
of the channel these days. Even if I don't get it, I know somehow this
community will continue to flourish as it has over almost two years. (I
just read that my first stream was on Jan 14, 2020).
