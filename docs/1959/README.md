# rwxrob.tv: !cal !sched !calendar !schedule !week !today !day

üïê I stream pretty much every day. The schedule changes all the time. Sometimes I good about following it. Other times the throw it out. But if I'm awake, I'm usually streaming --- even at !work. Follow https://bit.ly/rwxrobsched calendar if you like.

These days I'm mixing up streaming into the following activities:

* Music & Coworking - work from my comfy chair, no talking
* Live Music - from pubs and more
* Cycling - prep for longer adventure cycling camping
* Yoga - fat guy doing yoga with nice yoga music, sometimes at sunset
* Shopping - just stuff I need to get
* Art - gallery walks, "front-lawn Fridays", urban cycling and scooter in Charlotte, NC
* Sunsets - can't get enough of them, sometimes while cycling or yoga
* Cooking - mostly variations of cyclist and camping food, will it blend?, etc.
* Coding/Homelab/Tech - anything tech that I can do live
* Gaming/Hacking - music and chat while gaming and hacking
* Culture Journalism - interviewing and exploring culture of North Carolina, USA
* Doggie Play Time - take Sam for walks and Frisbee and (mock) hunting

Even though I rarely stick to the schedule, I find having one at least gives me something to at least structure what I *want* to do. I gotta get better at following one if I ever want to do anything significant, like cross USA on bike, travel abroad, get those books done, and regain some level of will-power. Like a lot of people, I'm still fighting "goblin-mode" that started from Covid (even though I have yet to catch it).
