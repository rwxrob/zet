# What editor are you using?

[[*Choose an Editor That's Right for You*]](https://youtu.be/420YRb3LVn8)

I'm a big `vi` user from before there was a `vim` so I have tried to
keep with the `vi` purity as much as possible. Recently, however, I've
realized that a lot of my favorite shortcuts and habits are actually
vimisms that crept into my regular editing sessions. So these days you
see me trying to adopt more of the things that only `vim` can do that
`vi` cannot. For example, I had not even used a `vim` macro until
October of 2020 and I've been using `vi` since 1996 or so.
