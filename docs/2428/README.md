# Non-nomadic living means more time for bike route planning

Working from a house, apartment, or hotel means I have more time to spend planning the perfect bike route. I'm not distracted by planning where I'm going to stay that night, or have a shower, or use the bathroom. I can obsess about my favorite part: finding the perfect route and riding it.

It also means that I can push my physical limits without the impending worry of what will happen when I finish the ride. Plus, I'll be reasonably close to civilzation if something goes wrong. This mental freedom is well worth giving up the freedom to sleep anywhere I wanted living out of the car. It reminds me of doing a supported bike ride when the sag wagon is always there. You don't have to worry about most of the logistics so you can just have fun. In fact, I plan on doing a lot more organized rides and capturing those on video.
