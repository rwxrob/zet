# Weekly physical training schedule

Wednesday, January 17, 2024, 8:03:10PM EST

Another update. I ended up gaining weight and losing fitness in December while I chased the futile dream of becoming a digital nomad by bike, buying tons of gear, testing it, and getting into bikepacking. I've since come to my senses and am back to a regular weekly routine broken up by a "rest" week every month that includes a three-day, medium-budget bikepacking adventure somewhere interesting as a reward for all my hard work.

In addition to the following I'll be getting up at 6:30 to do a 20 minute super easy wake-up ride plus 20 minutes of basic yoga every morning as soon as I step out of bed to take advantage of morning fasted state. This has always worked really well. Before I did it with barefoot running and yoga, but the bike is just ridiculously easy to do as soon as I wake.

|: Day :|: Description :|
|  Mon  | Recovery - 2 hours
|  Tue  | Zone 2 - 2 hours
|  Wed  | Zwift race - 1-2 hours
|  Thu  | Recovery - 2 hours
|  Fri  | Zone 2 ending with sprint/power intervals - 2 hours
|  Sat  | Recovery (outdoor bike maintenance and setup)
|  Sun  | Century - 6-9 hours

I'll do as many of the rides as I can outside. The only time I will ever be riding in the rain is for the outdoor century once a week to get used to riding in the elements. Plus, I will just have the waterproof action camera for that stuff. I plan to live stream at least every other day.

2023 has been the year of physical recovery. I let my obsession with code in 2022 destroy my health and it has been a *very* rough road back. I've lost 21 kilos since February but have another 10 to go before 2024---especially since I've registered for [Assault on Mt. Mitchell on May 20, 2024.](../2104)

Since the day light at the end of the day is gone, I've added daily yoga back to the mornings. Every day from 4-5am with pushups and bicycle situps added to the half-primary routine with a shorter Savasana at the end. I'll slowly build up to doing jump throughs, but the goal is flexibility, organ health through compression and inversion, and some core and upper body strength (which the bike does not do).

Riding bike daily from 4-5:30 outdoors doing an adaptation of my normal DCH 52k Loop.

The long, early bike rides on Sunday should condition me for doing exactly the same thing on May 20th. I have to adapt to the cold (and potentially rain) and prepare the right things to wear at that time of day. I'm thankful to be in North Carolina where the weather actual allows riding all year. Sunday rides are all Zone 2 with an occasional hill push but the goal is easy miles.

**This was in 2021 or so**

This is my current schedule. I've adjusted it over the last few weeks as
my strength and stamina has improved. I'm hoping to get around 27m in
the Turkey Trot 5K coming up. I'm 54 an still want to put on muscle from
my running, not shred it off. But I still have body fat to lose.

Temp runs cover lower body (for me) so strength training is all upper
body.

|: Day :|: Description :|
|  Mon  | Run, Slow, Base Endurance, 1m/30s (~60m) |
|  Tue  | Strength, Upper Body 3m between sets (~60m) |
|  Wed  | Walk, Recovery (~60m) |
|  Thu  | Run, Fast, 5K Tempo Glides 2m/1m (~30m), Race Day |
|  Fri  | Strength, Upper Body 3m between sets (~60m) |
|  Sat  | Run, Slow, Base Endurance, 1m/30s (~60m) |
|  Sun  | Walk, Recovery, Someplace Fun (~60m) |

After the upcoming 5K I should have the base fitness to add 20-90
minutes of morning Ashtanga Yoga back to the list. I'll have to adapt it
to running recovery and remember to not overly stress hamstrings
especially.

After that I just need to sustain it until I'm 100 and not waver. When I
was at my peak I was doing Ashtanga daily, running every other day, and
at least 90 minutes of stand-up paddle-boarding twice a week. Not
shooting for that again, but I do hope to add adventure cycling back in
as well to supplement the running with leg strength training. The most
important muscles to build up before heading into 60+ years are the
gluts and legs. They provide stability and lower back support. After a
certain age you pretty much no longer have the ability to build new
muscle, so better pack it on right before you get there. Just ask Mick
Jagger.
