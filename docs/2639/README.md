# Bikepacking (not bike touring)

> While the two are quite similar, and can often be used interchangeably to describe the same thing, there are some key differences that set bikepacking apart from bicycle touringâ€”particularly in terms of how we talk about and create routes. The primary distinction is a focus on off-pavement riding. (bikepacking.com)

Recently, I was looking for some tips on how to make my light-weight panniers work for what I want to do and I re-read the summary above of the difference between bike-packing and bike touring. This immediately prompted me to write this.

I *am* a bikepacker (not a bike tourist). I always prefer bring off road in nature someplace. Sometimes I to bikepacking on quiet paved roads and it feels a lot like bike touring, but the primary criterion is still the same: there is little or no traffic, I'm virtually "off pavement" even with the pavement there. I always take the gravel or sidewalk or trail through the suburban area, slowly.

The only reason I got confused is because it is impossible to be a DNB (digital nomad by bike) without also being a bike tourist. This is a sad realization I've made twice now based on the simple reality that working requires power and connectivity and even with a Starlink Mini I have to have some way to power up that laptop regularly. And when there is a daily power requirement, there is a daily requirement to be near power sources, and most power sources are connected to streets with traffic. In other words, DNB living is fundamentally incompatible with bikepacking.

However, it might be possible to sequentially attach the typical 3-day bikepacking trip with one day of overnight to recharge everything and then repeat. This remains to be tested and depends entirely on being able to survive (first) just with livestreaming every hour of a 3-day bikepacking trip.
