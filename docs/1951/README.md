# !help !questions !qca !faq rwxrob.tv

ðŸ¤· Gotta question? Just ask. No need to ask to ask, ever. Use !cmds to see all the commands you can try to get answers. And, if you want to answer a question for someone, got for it! If your answer is different than what I would answer, please at least mention my would-be answer rather than just directly contradicting me in my forum (which is rather rude). Thanks.

I'm happy to help when and if I can, but often I just can't. I like to help people help themselves. If you haven't done even minimal research expect to be occasionally mocked (in good fun). If you are asking us to do your homework or hack someone, forget it.
