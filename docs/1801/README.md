# 💡 Initial emojis as keg content node types

Every OS has a very easy way to add emojis, and for those that don't creating templates for `create` is going to be trivial with `keg` very soon. This means that using an initial emoji or two is the best way to categorize keg content nodes. They provide immediate visual feedback in whatever form and are so loosely specified that content creators can be creative in their use.

Here are my initial emoji title preferences:

| Emoji | Meaning | Template
|   -   | - | - |
|  ⚡   | Education, Tutorial, Help Learning, Mentoring | mentor |
|  📺   | Video, YouTube | youtube |
|  📷   | Photo, Image, Figure, Screenshot, Picture | figure |
|  💬   | Quote, Comment, Dialog, Conversation | quote |
|  💀   | Warning, Caution | warning |
|  🤬   | Profane, Rant | rant |
|  🤦   | Cluelessness, Really?! | really |
|  💢   | Struggle, ___ is hard | hard |
|  🎯   | Best Pick, Right Tools for Job | pick |
|  ✅   | Todo lists | todo |
|  🧾   | Journal, Log, Diary | log |
|  💡   | Big Idea, Thought, Breakthrough | idea |
|  👍   | Recommendation, Positive Review | thumbs up |
|  👎   | Avoid, Negative Review | thumbs down |
|  🤔   | Hummm, Discovery, Interesting, Thinking, Undecided | thinking |

I've decided put a single space after the emoji and to only use double-wide emojis (rather than their earlier smaller counterparts).

At the moment I have not yet cleaned out all my old zettels referring to other approaches involving "Figures". But, this initial emoji approach is really all that is needed. The rest can emerge organically from the KEG community.
