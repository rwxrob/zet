# Optimized personal search parameters for KEG and zettelkasten

Search algorithm in KEG is entirely under the control of each individual user. There are not search engines (or corporations) to gatekeep such things. Here are the different semantic divisions and other other criteria with their priority weighting.

***Updated*** - last recorded change in `keg-nodes` index
***Title*** - words in the title, always first line less than 70 bytes
***Summary*** - first paragraph under 380 bytes [500-len(url)]


For any of the categories individuals words can be removed or lowered in priority.
