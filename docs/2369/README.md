I added logging to my zettelkasten today. I wrote about it separately. Glad to have something that covers when things happened to track trends over time. Logs are just *when* moments happened, not the moment or idea itself. Those get their own entries.

Realized I don't ever need to write from my phone. I'll make a video short "story" instead. Then, if writing is needed, can supplement later.

Doing better keeping my rwxrob.tv live stream PG rated, although I did swear quite a bit earlier in the week when rig broke down.
