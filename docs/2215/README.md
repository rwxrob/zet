# Using tabs for indent in shell/bash

The official way to indent shell/bash code is to use a tab as referenced by the `<<-EOM` operator. I have avoided this because it is inconsistent (even unsafe) to mix methods and very few people have used tabs in shell code before that I have worked with. But I'm committing to using nothing but tabs in shell code going forward (which is also the convenient default of `shfmt`).
