# Safe IRL camping

Was just looking through reservations at a camp site online while streaming and realized one safety measure that I can do as an IRL streamer is to perhaps look at different camping sites together with the community, but not put anything on the calendar, or to look at a bunch of different ones and just put "camping" on the calendar. That way can just start streaming from one of them without advance notice of where it is going to be. Then can stream the overnight part without saying where it is, and then the morning can talk about where it is provided it is remote enough not to get sniped in a bad way. I don't really live in fear of sniping, in fact, I encourage it for friends in the community, but just a slight precaution.
