# Just discovered TEDN, "The Extreme Digital Nomad"

I mean, he looks almost exactly like me, even has my same classes, beard color, and baldness. What is it with people our age about needing to be free from the confines of borders (which still wanting money)? Oh yeah, we lived our teenage years in the 80s. üòÅ

Anyway, this guy has already locked down the "extreme digital nomad" brand, and rightly so. He's done a lot of amazing things. His [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theextremedigitalnomad) looks amazing. I hope to meet him one day. But the question remains if I should even refer to the name at all.

I think the answer is, "sure." Perhaps add a qualification to the name, like "by adventure bike" or dropping the "extreme" and just "bike touring digital nomad" or replacing "The" with "Biking" for "Biking Extreme Digital Nomad" (BEDN) or "Extreme Digital Nomad by Bike" (EDNB).

I do find it funny that another techie has obsessed about the acronym his brand has created (TEDN). Normal people don't obsess about such frivolity in that way. I really like this guy. It would be even better if his first name is actually Ted.

I think I should just stick with my own brand, "remote, wandering, explorer" (RWX).
