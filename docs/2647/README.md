# Ultra Digital Nomad by Bike (UDNB)

Rather than simply working and biking each day, an ultra digital nomad by bike does all the cycling necessary to connect camps during a hard push for 72 hours over the weekend, usually covering over 300 miles in that time (on flat terrain, less when elevation is a factor). The rest of the week a UDNB spends their time recoverying, working, and exploring.

## Remote employment required

Being a digital nomad fundamentally requires gainful employment that allows working 100% remotely. Thankfully, the number of these jobs has dramatically increased and continues to grow as the millenial work force has insisted on better working conditions. (Unfortunately, this demographic obviously does not include people still going to school who need their Summers to make money to pay for school.

## Budget

The entire point of DNB living is to really enjoy being out on the road while working guilt-free in a remote career for an amazing employer. Being gainfully employed while also adventuring by bicycle uniquely distinguishes a DNB from most of their adventure cycling peers who are usually indepedently weathly, employed as adventure athletes, or taking valuable time off from work. This means most DNBs shoulds have plenty of cash to spend making life as enjoyable as possible while living a luxurious nomadic life. The numbers in the budget, therefore, are higher than most would expect.

* 2400 lodging
* 800 food
* 200 maintenance
* 300 entertainment
* 300 travel

Notice these numbers are no different than most single people employed remotely would already spend anyway. In fact, single DNBs can arrange for an apartment (potentially with roommates) to be available after the season concludes (much like students do when they go home for the Summer to be ready when they return to school). This also does not count any money required to spend on storage while away for the Summer.

### Lodging

The expensive lodging budget catches most by surprise for being so high. Isn't the entire point of living nomadically to camp and rough it? Yes and no. Most of the places with full resources (shelter, power, water, showers) during the Summer months are going to be in areas where even a tent site costs 120 dollars per night (if you can even find one depending on how busy the location is). For example, lodging on the GDMBR/Tour Divide is notoriously high during peak season. Since a DNB's job fundamentally depends on reliable lodging and adequate rest lodging is never something to be cheap about. During the push, however, free camping is perfectly normal and expected.

Luxurious lodging is also the carrot pushing an UDNB along when it hurts most during the push. Imaging a great shower, possibly even a jacuzzi, and a soft bed that doesn't have to be made every day turns every push into a miniature event with a huge award awaiting at the finish. There's no constant worrying about where to get power, will there be adequate work accomodations, and where is the food.

## Variations

Since often the exact weekday does not matter to a remotely employed DNB, it is perfectly normal to stay in a spot longer than four days, perhaps followed by a longer push rather than the normal 72 hour push.
