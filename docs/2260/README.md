# yarn installer is SHIT!

If anything fucks with your `.bashrc` because it thinks it knows better than you then you can be sure the project is absolute fucking SHIT! I'm dont with `yarn` forever after this. I should have expected it since they *require* `curl | bash` anti-pattern for installation. What fucking idiots!!

All I can say is **thank God for `git restore` to throw this SHIT out**. Web devs are such FUCKING MORONS! They are the only class of industry workers who would ever think that was a good idea. Idiots.
