# Put Boilerplate at End of YouTube Description

After talking about this and researching it with the community (most of
whom have way more YouTube experience than I do) it has become obvious
that the best way to put your contact and sponsorship information is to
add a boilerplate trailer to *every* description. It is key to have this
be uniquely identified in every one so that I can write an API script
that adds --- and updates --- all the descriptions to every video on
demand. That is critical to making sure people know where stuff is. This
is yet another reason to make GitHub the main place that people go to
follow you *not* some other web site. Plus, the watches and stars on
GitHub will promote your GitHub content as well.
