# DNB without livestreaming

I've been playing with *normal*, as in "What would normal bikepackers (not livestreamers) do with a Starlink Mini?" The answer involves something like the following:

* Upload edited video
* Sync with navigate with GPS
* Communicate with family and critical work when out of phone range
* Occasional live stream from phone

This means that a two Baseus 65w 30,000 mAh battery packs (3.5 hours x 2) would be plenty for most 3-4 day bikepacking trips. This allows one brick to be recharging while the other is in use.

This also means that the 50G plan would usually be all that is required.
