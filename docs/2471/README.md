# Bike packing minimal layered clothing list

Living on the bike makes picking the best possible clothing absolutely critical. Most of the items I've purchased will be stuff I use daily for a good part of the rest of my life. For most things I only have exactly *one* of them. Each item has a very specific purpose (sometimes more than one).

This clothing kit is designed to handle any weather biking up to 30 kph anywhere in North America from Alaska to Brazil in Spring, Summer, and Fall, and anywhere south of Charlotte, NC in the Winter, in other words, some occasional hail storms and snow flurries but not every day. If more than 2-3 days of Winter weather persists I take shelter until it passes.

This kit assumes that I'm going to be able to wash my clothes every week or two on my rest day unless I'm completely away from people doing Tour Divide or something. I've picked wool, alpaca, and down to help with hygiene and smell (in addition to them being the best fibers for the job and planet). I've opted for a very expensive down layer since it will protect me in really windy cold conditions (that are common on clear days) for almost no additional weight cost.

## Head

* Giro Aether helmet
* Giro Peloton cap
* Meriwool Winter cuff beanie
* Comfy, casual baseball cap (usually strapped so I can swap helmet for it)
* EVEN NATURALS Premium Mosquito Head Net (lighter than tent and wearable while riding)
* Adidas SP 5003 glasses,  Crystal Grey, DigiVue Elite (trifocal), Verithin, Reflective, Transitions
* All-purpose merino gater and face mask (for cold and dust protection mostly)

## Top

Variable:

* REI synthetic, plaid, long-sleeve, collared hiker shirt

This shirt takes the place of a jersey and arm warmers since the sleeves can be rolled up and down. It is light enough to be a Summer layer shielding from the sun but also blocks wind so can be an ultra-light wind shell combined with a base layer. Beyond that, I take it off and use something designed for more because its impermeability just gets in the way of moisture escaping.

Base:

* Merino wool short-sleeve tee
* 2x Meriwool "heavy" thermal long-sleeve

Having a dry base layer to change into for bed (after drenching the other) is absolutely essential. I don't care if it is almost half a kilo and very bulky. I refuse to sleep miserably. And yes, I'm lugging both around with me in Summer for Tour Divide given the elevations involved. I've seen too many videos of people being underprepared just to be faster, not me. I'm also not giving up sleep.

Insulation, high exertion:

* Patagonia Nano-Air vest (grey)
* Patagonia Nano-Air hoody (green)

Insulation, low exertion:

* Mountain Hardware Ghost Whisperer down hoodie

Wind and water shells:

* LZLRUN reflective vest jacket
* Patagonia Houdini (blue)
* Patagonia Alpine Houdini hoody (grey, discontinued)
* Patagonia Super Alpine Jacket (yellow, orange)

Most of these layers are really light.

The Nano-Airs and Houdinis are for "during" while the down and Super Alpine are for "after."

The shells are definitely overkill for most of the year, but if there is one thing I do not want to skimp on it's emergency storm-weather preparedness. Hail storms all over the world produce torrential winter conditions instantly and I want to be ready. Just watch anyone on the Atlantic Coast of Ireland, or Monsoon season in Arizona, or the highest peak passes of the Tour Divide where people slog through multiple feet of snow. I never want to fear the weather, ever. After all, most of those who die from this stuff die from traffic or weather. If packing that extra weight buys me the confidence that I'll get through any storm off-the-beaten-path (where traffic is less) then it is worth it to me. Hell, I was lugging around a huge, heavy Kryptonite lock before, I'll be fine with a few grams for a shell that I could mountaineer in without a problem. In fact, I consider myself a mountaineer who happens to be on a bike (in Florida, no less).

Arm warmers are lame. I prefer to just put my Nano-Air hoody instead, or to just roll down my sleeves of my hiking shirts.

## Bottom

* [ExOfficio Give-n-Go Boxer Brief](https://amzn.to/47Qur27)
* 2x [BALEAF Men's Cycling Underwear 3D Padded Bike Shorts MTB Liner](https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=BALEAF%20Men%27s%20Cycling%20Underwear%203D%20Padded%20Bike%20Shorts%20MTB%20Liner)
* 2x Meriwool "heavy" thermal underwear bottoms
* Club ride 12" cycling shorts with belt loops and side pocket
* Arcade adventure belt
* Mountain Hardware Ghost Whisperer down pants
* Patagonia Dirt Roamer Storm shell pants

The cycling "underwear" double as a modest but tight swim suit or summer cycling shorts.

I only wear the shell pants when it is really cold wind and I've noticed I don't need my legs to ventilate as much as my torso when heavily exerting. These pants also do not catch on thorns and tear so I can walk through underbrush with them. I have even fallen and slid on them and had them hold up.

I prefer stopping and putting on the thermal underwear or my shell pants instead of knee warmers. Knee warmers get annoying over longer ride periods and don't really do as good a job as merino wool does.

## Feet

* SHIMANO SH-SD501 SPD Sandal (cut off about 1" to avoid toe strike)
* 2x [Hollowsocks Alpaca boot socks](https://hollowsocks.com/products/boot-performance-alpaca-socks)
* 2x Loose merino wool socks (fit over others)
* ROCKBROS mtb cycling shoe thermal, water resistant, wind-proof covers

Why only sandals? Because sandal layers are a thing. Sandals with nothing are the best Summer option. Sandals with socks cover most edge season weather. Sandals with full thermal covers morph into full on boots but are much more comfortable and good at insulating because of the roominess. Sandals are also easier to clean, maintain, and get into and out of. I can walk through a river with them and not have a problem. I can even swap out the socks and have a new, dry layer immediately. Using sandal layers means I only have one footwear system. Sandals also adapt to different thicknesses of socks and sock layers along with the dreaded feet swelling. Shoes cannot handle this at all. And if something isn't working out, I can always buy new socks. I can't do that with SPD shoes.

The wool socks have more loft and allow more air through so they are very cozy at slow speeds and higher temperatures. The Alpaca fit closer to the skin so initially feel cooler, but heat up quickly and don't let much wind through at all. Combining the two acts like a base layer and an insulation later. When the thermal cover shells are on I have a full 3-layer system. There's no possible shoe-based footwear system that can reach that level of comfort and variability, even when running into thick mud that blows out a set of socks since the plastic sandals can easily be washed and dry instantly.

## Hands

* Meriwool glove liners
* Patagonia soft shell convertible fingerless gloves/mittens

The glove liners are when things get really cold and for off-bike warmth. They also keep me from burning my fingers on the titanium mug when making hot beverages in the morning. The shell prevents wind and water from entering for setting up and breaking down camp without getting really cold fingers. In mitten mode, the soft shell gloves provide an insane amount of warm air build up that can face off against -10deg C with wind without paying a lot in weight for full on ski gloves.
