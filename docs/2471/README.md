# Bike packing minimal layered clothing list

Here are the clothes I bring on *any* bike packing trip, nor more, no less. These clothes are designed to handle any weather anywhere in North America during Spring, Summer, and Fall with the occasional Winter-y surprise day. If more than 2-3 days of Winter weather were to persist I'd seek some other form of shelter until it passed. (Eventually, I'll get a Selk bag so I can even continue to ride in extended Winter conditions so long as the road/trail is ride-able, which usually isn't if there is ice and snow.)
