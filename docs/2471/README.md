# Bike packing minimal layered clothing list

Living on the bike makes picking the best possible clothing absolutely critical. These are the *only* clothes I will be wearing for months at a time so I spare no expense to get the best possible options.

This clothing kit is designed to handle any weather biking up to 30 kph anywhere in North America from Alaska to Brazil in Spring, Summer, and Fall, and anywhere south of Charlotte, NC in the Winter, in other words, some occasional hail storms and snow flurries but not every day. If more than 2-3 days of Winter weather persists I take shelter until it passes.

This kit assumes that I'm going to be able to wash my clothes every week or two on my rest day unless I'm completely away from people doing Tour Divide or something. I've picked mostly wool and alpaca to help with hygiene and smell.

## Head

* Giro Aether helmet
* Tough Headwear cycling cap with flip-up brim for sun/rain
* Meriwool Winter beanie
* Comfy, casual baseball cap (usually strapped so I can swap helmet for it)
* EVEN NATURALS Premium Mosquito Head Net (lighter than tent and wearable while riding)
* Rudy Project sunglasses with perscription
* Regular prescription clear glasses with retention
* All-purpose gater and face mask (for dust protection mostly)

## Top

* 2x Merino wool short-sleeve tees (one always clean to wear while washing other stuff)
* Meriwool "heavy" thermal long-sleeve top base layer
* 2x REI nylon, plaid, long-sleeve, collared hiker shirts
* Patagonia Nano-Air "puffy" vest (grey)
* Patagonia Nano-Air "puffy" hoody (green)
* Patagonia Nano-Puff long-sleeve jacket (green, from avatar image)
* 2012 Patagonia Super Alpine Gortex shell

These layers can all be combined, even all of them at the same time in an extreme case. I prefer the Nano-Air stuff most because it breaths the best and is easiest to sleep in as well, very cozy.

My Patagonia shell is very brightly colored so often I will tie it around my waste and let some part of it flap in the wind for visibility.

## Bottom

* 2x BALEAF Men's Cycling Underwear 3D Padded Bike Shorts MTB Liner
* Meriwool "heavy" thermal underwear bottoms
* Club ride 12" cycling shorts with belt loops and side pocket
* Patagonia Dirt Roamer Storm shell pants

The cycling "underwear" double as a modest but tight swim suit or summer cycling shorts. I only where the shell pants when it is really cold wind because they don't ventilate very much at all.

## Feet

* SHIMANO SH-SD501 SPD Sandal (cut off about 1" to avoid toe strike)
* 2x Yeblues merino wool socks
* 2x [Hollowsocks Alpaca boot socks](https://hollowsocks.com/products/boot-performance-alpaca-socks)
* ROCKBROS cycling shoe toe covers
* ROCKBROS mtb cycling shoe thermal, water resistant, wind-proof covers

Those sandals are pretty heavy, but they prevent me from having to carry an additional pair of shoes. When combined with the other stuff they turn into winter-weather footwear suitable for almost anything but walking through freezing water. The idea is that if a pair of socks get blown because they get soaking wet (even though wool and alpaca keep warm when wet) that I can swap them out for a brand new pair and essential get new "shoes" instantly. This approach is impossible when using shoes instead. When shoes get soaked, it is a huge problem to unsoak them---especially when the weather is bad out. The American indigenous have known this forever and therefore never went the shoe route.

Sandals also adapt to different thicknesses of socks and sock layers along with the dreaded feet swelling. Shoes cannot handle this at all.

The Yeblues are more comfortable to wear and lighter weight from the Alpaca socks, which fit tighter. This combo works well so that one pair of Hollowsocks under the Yeblues makes an incredible, breathable layered foot warmth system. When there is rain or wind. Adding the toe covers first, and then the full thermal bootie makes sure my feet are *never* cold.

## Hands

* Meriwool glove liners
* Patagonia soft shell convertible fingerless gloves/mittens

The glove liners are when things get really cold and for off-bike warmth. They also keep me from burning my fingers on the titanium mug when making hot beverages in the morning. The shell prevents wind and water from entering for setting up and breaking down camp without getting really cold fingers.

## Storage

* Osprey Seral 7L Unisex Biking Waist Pack with Hydraulics Reservoir

All my layers fit into a single waist pack. I find I'll just tie off my shell and sometimes another long-sleeve layer around my waste as well so I can put it back on quickly.
