# Bike packing minimal layered clothing list

Living on the bike makes picking the best possible clothing absolutely critical. Most of the items I've purchased will be stuff I use daily for a good part of the rest of my life. For most things I only have exactly *one* of them. Each item has a very specific purpose (sometimes more than one).

This clothing kit is designed to handle any weather biking up to 30 kph anywhere in North America from Alaska to Brazil in Spring, Summer, and Fall, and anywhere south of Charlotte, NC in the Winter, in other words, some occasional hail storms and snow flurries but not every day. If more than 2-3 days of Winter weather persists I take shelter until it passes.

This kit assumes that I'm going to be able to wash my clothes every week or two on my rest day unless I'm completely away from people doing Tour Divide or something. I've picked wool, alpaca, and down to help with hygiene and smell (in addition to them being the best fibers for the job and planet). I've opted for a very expensive down layer since it will protect me in really windy cold conditions (that are common on clear days) for almost no additional weight cost.

## Head

* Giro Aether helmet
* Giro Peloton cap
* Meriwool Winter cuff beanie
* Comfy, casual baseball cap (usually strapped so I can swap helmet for it)
* EVEN NATURALS Premium Mosquito Head Net (lighter than tent and wearable while riding)
* Adidas SP 5003 glasses,  Crystal Grey, DigiVue Elite (trifocal), Verithin, Reflective, Transitions
* All-purpose merino gater and face mask (for cold and dust protection mostly)

## Top

Variable:

* REI synthetic, plaid, long-sleeve, collared hiker shirt

This shirt takes the place of a jersey and arm warmers since the sleeves can be rolled up and down. It is light enough to be a Summer layer shielding from the sun but also blocks wind so can be an ultra-light wind shell combined with a base layer. Beyond that, I take it off and use something designed for more because its impermeability just gets in the way of moisture escaping.

Base:

* Merino wool short-sleeve tee
* 2x Meriwool "heavy" thermal long-sleeve

Having a dry base layer to change into for bed (after drenching the other) is absolutely essential. I don't care if it is almost half a kilo and very bulky. I refuse to sleep miserably. And yes, I'm lugging both around with me in Summer for Tour Divide given the elevations involved. I've seen too many videos of people being underprepared just to be faster, not me. I'm also not giving up sleep.

Insulation, high exertion:

* Patagonia Nano-Air vest (grey)
* Patagonia Nano-Air hoody (green)

Insulation, low exertion:

* Mountain Hardware Ghost Whisperer down hoodie

Wind and water shells:

* LZLRUN reflective vest jacket
* Patagonia Houdini (blue)
* Patagonia Alpine Houdini hoody (grey, discontinued)

Most of these layers are really light.

The Nano-Airs are for "during" while the down is for "after". Their biggest flaw is how little they compress. They just take up so much damn space.

The water-resistant shell layers are only for medium emergency rain since I have no plans of ever biking in continual rain since I can just wait it out and work or rest (like any other animal would).

The combined weight of the Houdini's is a lot less than my Gortex shell and provide different levels of breathability (Alpine almost none, but better medium rain shell). They also pack down a lot more.

Arm warmers are lame. I prefer to just put my Nano-Air hoody instead, or to just roll down my sleeves of my hiking shirts.

## Bottom

* [ExOfficio Give-n-Go Boxer Brief](https://amzn.to/47Qur27)
* [BALEAF Men's Cycling Underwear 3D Padded Bike Shorts MTB Liner](https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=BALEAF%20Men%27s%20Cycling%20Underwear%203D%20Padded%20Bike%20Shorts%20MTB%20Liner)
* 2x Meriwool "heavy" thermal underwear bottoms
* Club ride 12" cycling shorts with belt loops and side pocket
* Arcade adventure belt
* Mountain Hardware Ghost Whisperer down pants
* Patagonia Dirt Roamer Storm shell pants

The cycling "underwear" double as a modest but tight swim suit or summer cycling shorts.

I only where the shell pants when it is really cold wind because they don't ventilate very much at all.

I prefer stopping and putting on the thermal underwear instead of knee warmers and since my underwear look like cycling shorts I can do this pretty much anywhere without getting too many weird looks. Knee warmers get annoying over longer ride periods and don't really do as good a job as merino wool does.

## Feet

* SHIMANO SH-SD501 SPD Sandal (cut off about 1" to avoid toe strike)
* 3x [Hollowsocks Alpaca boot socks](https://hollowsocks.com/products/boot-performance-alpaca-socks)
* ROCKBROS cycling shoe toe covers
* ROCKBROS mtb cycling shoe thermal, water resistant, wind-proof covers

Why only sandals? Because sandal layers are a thing. Sandals with nothing are the best Summer option. Sandals with socks cover most edge season weather. Sandals with toe covers breath while handling wind. Sandals with full thermal covers morph into full on boots. Sandals are also easier to clean, maintain, and get into and out of. I can walk through a river with them and not have a problem. I can even swap out the socks and have a new, dry layer immediately. Using sandal layers means I only have one footwear system. Sandals also adapt to different thicknesses of socks and sock layers along with the dreaded feet swelling. Shoes cannot handle this at all. And if something isn't working out, I can always buy new socks. I can't always do that with shoes.

## Hands

* Meriwool glove liners
* Patagonia soft shell convertible fingerless gloves/mittens

The glove liners are when things get really cold and for off-bike warmth. They also keep me from burning my fingers on the titanium mug when making hot beverages in the morning. The shell prevents wind and water from entering for setting up and breaking down camp without getting really cold fingers.
