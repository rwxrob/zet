# I'm going to ride my bike to Spartenburg and back for Assault

Just realized [the route from home to Assault starting line](https://www.strava.com/routes/3159762846388286816) it is barely over 100 miles (178km). By May, that will be super easy having done over 30 solo century Sundays before that. I just need to leave really, really early on Saturday to avoid traffic in the scary parts of the Lake crossing and take all of Sunday to recover. I ride the "race" on Monday, then sleep over another night, get fresh, and ride home on Tuesday timing the traffic across the damn as best as I can (which I've already ridden across several times and is the official "bike route" across the lake despite how horrible it is).
