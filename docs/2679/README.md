# Better to use the web ChatGPT interface

I am realizing that in order to leverage the contextual additions of ChatGPT it is best to just startup a session in the app or on the web. I had been using `mods` to do it from the command line, which is amazing, but lacks the ability to link the queries to one another with the same context as the last query.

It appears to be that context can be passed between web CLI queries, but just doesn't seem worth it because have to capture the query from the previous output and cache it to a file so that it can be passed to the next query. I suppose that does have the advantage of persisting beyond what would happen by default through the web interface.

Perhaps the biggest factor is the cost. Querying the API is not included in the cost of using the application or monthly subscription for the web interface.
