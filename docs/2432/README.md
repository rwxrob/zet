# Modes of life and stuff I need for it

I'm in the middle of reorganizing all my stuff (and life) and it helps to categorize the activities or modes of living I'm into. This probably seems like obsessive behavior but I find it helps me relax. It's like coding for life. When I need to activate a mode I know where all the stuff is, where to get it, and how to close down that mode and switch to a new one. This makes me think of Mr. Rogers for some reason. Remember how he would transition from work to casual? He had an exact routine for how that happened every day making it less stressful mentally. I'm the same way.

* Working
* Sleeping
* Writing
* Reading
* Watching
* Traveling
* Cycling
* Filming
* Gaming
* Socializing
* Wandering
* Dancing
* Yoga
* Paddling

Archived modes that I have activated in a while (but might again someday so I'll keep the stuff around):

* Surfing
* Longboarding
* Rollarblading
* Swimming
* Running
* Hiking
* Backpacking
* Skiing/Snowboarding
