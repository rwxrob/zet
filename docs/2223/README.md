# TT/Sprinter's life for me (in Zwift)

***Update: Monday, September 25, 2023, 10:42:34AM EDT***

Revised my cycling goals from focusing on sprinting to focusing on endurance cycling (100km per day). It's healthier in the long run and enables more fun things outdoors. Also, Zwift is just for days that I absolutely cannot go outside because it is pouring rain and I would be miserable the whole time. New goal is to get used to riding outside every single day that I wouldn't be stuck in a hotel or the tent on a cycling trip. Aversion for the rain is mostly because of the electronics that I normally bike with, but if I can waterproof the rig I would even ride in the rain. I want cycling to be a daily thing for the rest of my life (combined with occasional yoga for strength and flexibility).

I would never consider being a sprinter in real-life cycling. It's way too dangerous. I do wish I had done velodrome racing as a kid, but didn't have nearly the money for such things. But now that I have a top-of-the-line (if not THE top of the line) indoor racing trainer I don't have to be afraid of anything but a cardiac arrest from pushing too hard.

Sprinter bodies are more normal than other toothpick cyclists. They are more well-balanced, like triathletes. This is why I was attracted to triathlon even though I don't have a natural triathlete body (I'm way too short). Having a normal body means that I have more muscle mass going into my 50s and 60s, a major health concern.

Zwift still gives a weight advantage so being short will play to my advantage as a sprinter. I can pack a ton of power into my legs and core and keep a much lower weight which will destroy the field on flats and sprints. I'll still be light enough to manage climbs, but will absolutely dominate on rolling hills, which happen to be the normal terrain all around my home here in NC.

I can also get into time trials because there is no wind resistance, but sprinting against someone right next to me without fear for getting hurt is the ultimate thrill Zwift can offer, for me. Suffering up a hill better than the others just isn't nearly as strategic or fun.

My new target weight is 72 kilos (and 3% body fat). I was shooting for 60 (to dominate climbs) but no more. I've been doing upper body strength training as well and will be swimming again as well. This shift will have be focusing on more fast-twitch muscle fibers, more rolling hills, more short and hard intervals, and more body and weight strength training. I've already gone *up* 1.3 kilos in the last weeks while losing 3% body fat. It seems to be the natural, viking body type I was genetically born with. Might as well lean into it.

Time to start shooting for 1000 watts and more.
