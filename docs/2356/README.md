# Live streaming modes and rigs

Being a variety streamer means you have a lot of different ways of streaming. To a beginner this can be overwhelming. Just getting your first desktop streaming rig working is a huge accomplishment. But that is just the beginning. Here are the main streaming modes of pretty much any variety streamer that adds "outdoor IRL" in both urban and remote areas. Note this describes my specific situation and preferences as an active, outdoor-loving American who is married to a professional artist. Both of us prefer to be out of the house doing things whenever possible.
