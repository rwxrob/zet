# Researching full-face helmets

After knocking my four front teeth out, breaking my nose and upper palette inside my skull, and grinding away a big part of my beard and upper gums I'm going to get a full-face helmet if I want to be comfortable cycling *anywhere* in the US and living to keep doing it.

I figure since I'm going full face might as well get a motorcycle grade helmet in the light-weight class. That way I can actually ride a rented ebike or even motorcycle depending on the town I'm in and be okay either way.

Here's a list I'm going to maintain of my favorite helmets while researching them:

## Price

I'm paying at least 300 dollars. You can't get a decent helmet for less.

## Weight

It'll have to be carbon fiber. I just cannot do even casual geometry bike with the weight of a heavy helmet to port around.

## Temperature control

Vents should cover it. When (and if) I'm busting the FTP stuff and really going hard I'll just wear my other helmet (and leave the IRL rig ag home). I need the helmet when I'm around lots of cars and people and not really pushing it hard physically so sweating isn't as big an issue. I also usually wear casual clothes so I don't stand out going into a bar or something. In those cases, a full-face helmet doesn't present a temperature problem, and since I don't have hair to mess up, that problem is covered as well.

## Audio

Having Bluetooth audio is going to be a requirement otherwise I won't be able to hear anyone chatting in the live stream. With the external speaker I already have to crank it up when there is traffic and wind noise and that blows away the vibe sometimes.

Speaking in a way that the cam mic can pick up is going to be tough as well.

## Style

The cooler it looks, the more likely I am to ride with the thing. Has to have visor with face shield. That will keep the sun glare out and let me wear my regular glasses (which allow me to read my phone and stuff unlike the Rudy project inserts).
