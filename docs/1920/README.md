# rwxrob.tv: !tldr

👋 Welcome to 📺 rwxrob.tv! 😊 We're happy you're here. 🤔 We are a community of nerdy !coworking,  autodidacts motivating one another to get stuff done, changing the world, listening to music, and occasionally chatting. ❓ Gotta question? Go ahead, ask. It may be answered in one of the !cmds or by searching with !zetq or !vidq. I'll try to answer during the short break at the top of the hour (when 🍅 !pomo goes to zero). Bienvenue aux francophones. Добро пожаловать к русскоговорящим.
