As an on-prem cloud-native infrastructure engineer I'm realizing the
following technologies and commands are absolutely critical to master as

`docker-compose` and will put that in a different place):

* `buildah`
* `skopeo`

Kubernetes Core

* `kind`
* `minikube`
* `kubeadm`
* `kubelet`
* `kubectl`
* `etcd`
* `etcdctl`
* `etcdutl`

Kubernetes Critical Applications

* `helm`
* `istioctl`

Identify and Authentication Management

* `openldap`
* `kerberos`

Certificates

* `openssl`
* `kubeadm init phase ...`

General Utilities

* `ssh`/`scp`
* `rsync`
* `curl`
* `jq`
* `yq`
* `gpg`
