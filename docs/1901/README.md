# Books to complete by end of 2023

***Saturday, February 18, 2023, 9:30:05PM EST***

Not gonna happen 2023. This is a good goal for the year *after* we get settled down in our new place where we will be for at least two years. Need to focus on health and other stuff first.

----

I *must* finish at least the first drafts of the following books by the end of 2023, the sooner the better (some of them are waiting on the software to be finished first):

1.  Tap That KEG, Manage Knowledge Like Software with Knowledge Exchange Graphs
2.  Terminal Velocity: Mastering the Fastest Human-Computer Interface
3.  Go Bonzai! Building Modern, Stateful, Speakable Command Trees
4.  Modern Parsing Expression Grammars with PEGN and Go Ratex

The Boosts have been good and all, but they have always been very loosely organized. This makes them approachable and all, but having a solid, consistent resource outline to guide that has always been the goal. All the KEG work I've been doing has been with the ultimate goal of making it faster and easier to write and maintain these books and sites a reality.
