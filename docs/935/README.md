# PostgreSQL Database is "so good, it's boring"

I love what Kelsey Hightower had to say about my beloved PostgreSQL. I
learned it in 2004 having printed out all the manuals on paper and
reading through them. I was so obsessed. I still am, actually. Now that
it has an image and Kubernetes operator. This is definitely one to
watch. I can't believe people consider any of the other databases out
there in the same space (Maria, etc.)
