# Why do you go running at specific time?

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/dZyztVS1Zc4>

1. My biggest challenge is consistency (in life) and will-power
1. My body has limbered up by then
1. Temperatures work year round
1. I've started to look forward it  
1. Vary the intensity but not the time
1. Only 30 minutes
