We have gone from living in a black-mold-infested, hell-hole to living in what I consider paradise, and ironically the rent is only 300 dollars more. The new Davidson, North Carolina apartment is beyond gorgeous. It's everything I have ever wanted in a living place:

* Overgrown with mature gree trees, every window is a real nature painting
* Surrounded by manicured gravel paths
* Incredibly safe neighborhood surrounded by upper-middle-class suburbs
* On my favorite lake with free paddleboard slips
* Friendly families and Davidson college student neighbors
* Patio big enough for yoga, storing my bikes, and testing camping gear
* Electronic combo lock entry so no key to lose
* Equal walking distance to both major Davidson event locations
* One block from Hurt Hub (coworking, linux meetups) and Ignite (for autistic son)
* One mile from great gravel trails and about three miles from flowy single-track
* 60 miles from uptown Charlotte making biking to Critical Mass easily doable
* One mile from "Goblin Route" so no need to drive to start location
* No yard to keep up whatsoever
* Lakeview barbeque locations and picnic areas
* Community firepit for fall campfires
* No more unexplainable resipitory problems
* No carpets whatsoever, all vinyl easily cleaned and dusted
* A tub that has enough hot water to be filled without turning lukewarm
* A much better layout making entertaining guests much easier
* Plenty of room for family to live and prosper after college
* A living space to be proud of and have multiple friends over to visit and party (finally)
* Cheap enough to have monthly money left over to pay down debts and save for UDNB Summer living
