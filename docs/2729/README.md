# Positive things about Neovim

* It's what most people use so easy to collaborate
* Floating screenkey window (`NStefan002/screenkey.nvim`)
- Bar/block cursor indicating insert/command mode
- Lua instead of VimScript (especially for beginners)
- Ability to leave `~/.vimrc` where it is
- Progressive enhancement with `if (nvim)`
- The `:Inspect` command
- `:help` syntax highlighting way better, plus spell check disabled
* Best in class code completion S
* Live display of `:%s/` things is far more informative
