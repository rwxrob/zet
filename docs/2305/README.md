# Preparing defenses against the worst of Americans

I give up. America is *shit* when it comes to transportation and it will be for as long as I'm alive. If I want to do a live-stream, cross-America expedition I have to account for the worst possible cycling conditions in America, land of the shit-heads who actually push cyclists off the road, killing them (which happened to an acquaintance in Oregon on a completely lonely road, not bothering anyone). America contains some of the worse human beings in existence, and some of the best. If I'm going to find the good ones, I'm gonna need to go to fucking battle with the shitheads to stay upright and alive. If that means full fucking face armor, so be it. I'm not letting these pricks decide how I live my life. I just have to improve my defenses (and weaponry).

Escalation is never the answer (as much as I want it to be). So staying out of their way is best, unfortunately. 

I fucking *hate* that this burden is on *me* and not the shit-stains responsible for all these accidents, but that is just the reality of 'Merica in 2023. We are talking about a country that made pedestrians into "jays" based on an automobile association highly financed campaign to sway public opinion against those using the streets and not the automobiles killing people on them. I can't think about it too much because it makes me *really* fucking mad.
