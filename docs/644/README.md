# Q: What are prerequisites to learning Kubernetes?

üì∫ <https://youtu.be/griUcM_QSdk>

A stage approach seems to be materializing from my own struggles to
learn the entirety of Kubernetes.

Before you begin any of this you must have proficiency in the following:

* Become an Autodidact
* Linux Bash Command Line
* Git and GitHub for Source Management
* CommonMark Markdown
* Bash Scripting (`shellcheck`)
* JSON / YAML
* Go Template Language
* Web Essentials (HTML, CSS, Plain JavaScript, DOM, HTTP)
* Networking and Network Troubleshooting
* Using and Creating Containers with `docker` and `Dockerfile`
* You can learn `docker-compose` if you want, then `kustomize`
* Deep Understanding of x.509 Certificates and `openssl`

Here's a quick overview in a prioritized order:

1.  Get familiar with Kubernetes component architecture and communication
2.  Get familiar with all standard Kubernetes resources
3.  Use `kind` to deploy a simple app
4.  Use `minikube` to deploy a simple app with an exposed service
5.  Use `kubeadm init` to deploy cluster in VirtualBox and app
6.  Use `kubeadm init` to deploy cluster in Docker and app
7.  Use `kubeadm init phase` to deploy cluster one phase at a time and app
8.  Deploy single-node cluster in phases ‚Äúthe hard way‚Äù (no `kubeadm`)
9.  Use `kubeadm` to deploy multi-node cluster using cloud provider
10. Deploy multi-node cluster in cloud without `kubeadm`
11. Use `kubeadm` to deploy multi-node cluster on-prem on own hardware
12. Deploy multi-node cluster on-prem on own hardware without `kubeadm`

When you finish all of these 12-steps you'll easily pass any
certification exam and would be immediately able to deploy any
Kubernetes flavor for any potential customer or organization.

Keep in mind this does *not* include all of the extra stuff anyone needs
to understand and deploy that comes along with Kubernetes (Istio, Helm,
ElasticSearch, Prometheus, Thanos, Sidero, Calico, Nginx, OpenSSL
Certificates, etc.)
