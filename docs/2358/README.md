# Much better success with Kubernetes `minikube` + KVM driver

It's long been a shoot-out between `kind` and `minikube` but once I've used `minikube` with KVM backing it I really have no desire to use anything else. These are *machines* (not containers) and they behave exactly like a machine would be expected to behave. This means that full testing of things like storage metrics and classes can be done without the confusion and bugs of doing the same with a container instead. Plus KVM is the gold standard in virtualisation used by every major cloud provider on the planet, so there is much less chance that something is going to be unsupported or out of sync. In fact, a KVM backed `minikube` is *so* good you almost don't even need to bother with the hassle of setting up a `kubeadm` cluster at all (other than training to support such clusters in production).
