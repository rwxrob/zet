# Going for "lofi" girl feel, but old yoga dude, and live (on Twitch)

Something that started as a way to work in a more relaxed position than sitting at attention at the microphone all day while streaming has turned into a new kind of normal for my rwxrob.tv Twitch stream. I just stream IRL stuff and most of the time I am just sitting and typing on my laptop while music plays, not unlike the "lofi girl" from Chillhop on YouTube. Then, when I get up I just grab my IRL rig and continue streaming whatever I'm doing in the rest of the house (for the most part). I've been testing streaming to the ASMR category for all this stuff since there is no chatting at all. It's been surprising to have so many people tune in for it, but this is the kind of stream I would put on my television in this room if I weren't doing the streaming myself.

One big advantage is that I can actually stream while working on the laptop and choose what they can see and not. Most of the time when doing work stuff I just don't want anyone to see anything about my screen. Then other times, I can broadcast it as well.
