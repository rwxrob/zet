# Is Alex Jones Really Bill Hicks?

God I don't know, but the resemblance on several levels is fucking
unbelievable. The line at the end where he says he wants his kids to
look up to people "who fucking rock!" you can see him take on the Alex
Jones persona that he's making a bit about to make that point that such
people are the paragon of what he thinks has value. What is so
convincing is the actual way he speaks and moves and contorts his face. 

Another theory is that Jones liked hick so much he essentially became
him.
