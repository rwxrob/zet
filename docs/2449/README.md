Okay, @everyone so I changed rwxrobtv to rwxrobfun (because it's not tv at all). I think I'll stream some Overwatch or Dota2 tonight on rwxrobfun so if you want to join me for that you can. I'm just doing that to have some company and talk while doing silly stuff.

I'm absolutely, completely done with Outdoor IRL streaming forever and have started selling all that gear and getting rid of all those accounts. Let me know if you want to buy any of it. It's been a horribly expensive lesson to learn (having burned through damn year $8000 in experimentation, cameras, pis and such) but I was right about it all from the very start. The best IRL is just a phone from a place with a good signal and possibly a gimble. Everything else is better done with a recording, photo, "reel" or write up. Plus it makes me want to vomit remembering all the stress from it all in comparison to the absolute bliss I've experienced recently getting out and just being present in the moment. I made the mistake of watching a few outdoor IRL streamers recently after having been away and I was just shaking my head the whole time. Most of them are great people. Others are completely disgusting human beings. All I could think of was "why, why, why?"

What the *hell* was I thinking? 

I'm just glad I figured it out before I wasted more money. TerryB was so right (even though he's long since deleted that live stream of him talking about why he got out of live streaming).

I've also decided just on recording video (and not audio) only for cycling because no matter how well I get the mics setup there is always something that you don't want in the sound mix (and I don't even have a loud freewheel like so many others have). Since I'm not talking to anyone I'm more in the moment, like a bike messenger picking out the best lines, and my intensity and fun are a lot better. I only record cycling videos for something to look at when indoor cycling anyway and to capture any accident that might happen, which is why I'm adding a second, rear-facing cam as well. The changes in my outdoor cycling have restored it to the favorite "game" I used to play (again).

I *really* hate admitting this to myself, but live streaming is the reason I lost my teeth. It was the reason I went to Common Market, the reason I drank an extra beer with Surf, the reason I forgot to turn on my front light, the reason I was chatting about IRL rigs with Kyputer when I missed the car pulling out. That entire night would have been wildly different had I been in the moment *enjoying* the moment. But I let myself get distracted, for good reasons, but still the wrong reasons.

Tomorrow on rwxrob I'll be streaming more stuff about building a Kubernetes site that uses MkDocs.
