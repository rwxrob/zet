# Facebook Proves Stupidity Once Again with DINO

DINO might be a worthwhile framework for machine learning, but calling
it DINO *knowing* that Deno is already a thing and already uses a Dino
the Dinosaur logo makes it clear that Facebook doesn't even have a tiny
clue about this brand stuff. They are totally disconnected from the
world and think everyone should use what they produce. Like that one
time when Facebook tried to slip their own legal self-promotion into an
"open source" license before they were bludgeoned by Apache Foundation
into doing the right thing and re-releasing under a truly open source
license. People using Facebook technology deserve *exactly* what they
get (except GraphQL, although I'm changing my thinking on that recently
after seeing some really good REST and generic Web API implementations).
