# Why bikepacking?

Bikepacking is the best way to just ride my bike as fast as I can with as little contact with traffic and random humans as possible. I could care less where a route is or goes or if it is paved, gravel, or single-track so long as it is safe, visually interesting, and challenges me physically. Some call this "race touring."

While I do enjoy camping, I would prefer to be moving rather than sitting. This is why Tour Divide originally appealed to me. I absolutely do not want to spend any time preparing food, worrying about bears, or even making a fire. I just want to ride. Eating and drinking are just annoying requirements.

Other bikepackers have different reasons for enjoying this fast-growing outdoor sport. These are mine.
