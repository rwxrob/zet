# Please Initial Cap Kubernetes Object Names

One of the biggest annoyances when reading through information about
Kubernetes is identifying proper nouns for things like Kubernetes
Objects from the same or similar general term. For example, a *Service*
is a way Kubernetes implements a *service*. In general, I wish authors
took more time to get proper nouns capitalization right. It would make
digesting tech content so much easier.
