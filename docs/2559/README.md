# Whether to use GitHub PAT or SSH key pair?

Personal access tokens and ssh key pairs are functionally equivalent. So why use one over the other?

* PAT allows for specific TTL but non-expiring are generally against security policy
* SSH keys are generally considered forever
* PATs are generated by the GitHub service requiring web GUI access
* SSH keys are generated by `ssh-keygen` independently
