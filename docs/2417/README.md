# New daily routine, nomadic-ish

1. Get up relatively early
1. Wait for traffic to die down
1. Drive to the day's "office" location (outdoors, coffee shops, etc.)
1. Test the wifi signal (6k bitrate minimum)
1. Work for most of day
1. Take off on bike for ride (but only record in 4k, don't stream)
1. Return and stream the sunset from laptop
