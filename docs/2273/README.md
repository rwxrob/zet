# Burying dream of building a fixie until get a house

I just don't have any room to build one. I really want to, but just not happening. (Unless maybe I took a part-time job for a bike shop, hummm.) But I can plan it out and gradually collect the parts over time. I want to build one out of the cheapest possible parts preferably recycled from really old bikes that other people would be throwing away. That's one of the greatest things about building a fixie is that if it gets stolen it's not that big of a deal. It adds a element of freedom back to urban cycling that is really nice. There is no way I would bike around the city making frequent stops at different places with a 6000 dollar bike. But put SPD pedals on a fixie so that the casual person wouldn't even be able to get away on it even if they did steal it and bolt on the front and back wheels (no quick release) and you have a bike that almost doesn't even need to be locked up---especially if you don't even put brakes on it. The fact that fixies are so fucking impossible for completely average people to even ride without killing themselves is yet another reason to have one for riding around town. Only another fixie rider could even get away with stealing it if they had to ride it to get away. And those thieves who are gathering up bikes into a van in snatch-n-grab style could care less about your ultra-cheap piece of shit.
