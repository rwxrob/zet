## It's cold here

I slept great last night here in Pullman, Washington (next to Moscow, Idaho) even though it dipped down to 40F. I had to pull out my crash sack bag (rated at 45F) and us my liner and slept with my puffy jacket. It was glorious sleep, but my feet did get a little cold and I could tell there was a bad draft around my feet. I've tried to sleep in <32F weather with that bag with all the supplements and it just doesn't pass. For that I do need a proper sleeping bag like my Mountain Hardwear Bishop's Pass (even though it is down) or Marmot Trestle's.

I'm happy for the cold snap. It's helped me realize I still need some gear I already threw out, like my Gortex outer shell layers. I went for a quick ride this morning while it was still 47F out and about froze with just my long underwear and both puffy layers. I know I would eventually heat up enough to just wear that, but to start out it was completely unbearable. I put on my outer shells and Altair shoes and I was fine. Had there been a light rain or snow with that wind while riding it would have been impossible without the shell layers. So I've added them back, no matter how heavy they are. Moving to the Mini should give me back 46 lbs so should be able to get back to "standard" GDMBR touring weights for the bike.

## Too acclimated to heat?

Considering I was in 100+F weather just yesterday, getting hit with these low temps has me dizzy and feeling really lethargic. Maybe I'm malnourished. I've been eating a lot, but the food hasn't been the highest quality. Could be the Black Butte Porter I had last night at the pub next to Planet Fitness.

## Check Planet Fitness schedule

Turns out Planet Fitness isn't actually 24 hours, 7 days a week. Today (Saturday) this one didn't open until 7. I was driving all around trying to find a place to poop in an urban area. Had it been remote I would just just dug a whole in the ground like usual.

## Great views every day

Loving the scenes from the car, perhaps too much, I'm not getting on the bike a lot last day or so because been driving so much. I can tell. My fitness starts to wane.

## Trouble finding time for everything

Even though I have plenty of time for work, the rest of the stuff I used to do from "home" is harder to fit in. Something as simple as a daily bike ride is actually a lot harder on the road. My home Goblin route might be monotonous, but it is always there. Out on the road I never know if I will be able to stash the car in a safe enough way to bike off into the sunset and leave it there. This makes me spend a lot more time finding the perfect spot and planning trips. I do lot that part of it, but it just takes time.
