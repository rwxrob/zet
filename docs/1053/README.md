# Natural Language (Pre)Processing with BERT

As much as I am into languages and language processing BERT makes want
to get into it even more. Now that SmartPhones are back in the house
(despite the privacy concerns) I feel myself gravitating to wanting to
do even more with conversational user interfaces, which involves things
like [CmdBox](https://github.com/rwxrob/cmdbox) but also NLP, and
therefore BERT. When the time comes to get *really* into machine
learning, my natural attraction is to the NLP side of things. There's
something really cool about working with the voice processing systems of
our world potentially eliminating a major barrier to easy computer use.
