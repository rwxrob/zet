# Use GitHub Actions to build and release golang projects

Completed first successful CI/CD of a Go project <https://github.com/rwxrob/kubeconf>. The `.github/workflows` directory contains the code required for the GitHub Actions. One that will trigger for anything that is pushed and another only when a tag beginning with `v` is created.
