# McDonald's and Taco Bell are DNB truck-stop equivalents

Truckers have Casey's and Love's truck stops to regroup before they continue on.

McDonald's and Taco Bell have put their overwhelming resources to transform any modern location to a remote office place. As I write this I am surrounded by fit people who appear very well educated using their Macbook Pros and dressed in expensive outdoor gear with serious looks on their faces apparently getting work done. I count myself among them.

Here, in any one of the thousands of these restaurants that dot the land of America even in the most remote places, I can keep an eye on my power station recharging with my power bricks lined up charging on top of it in the corner. Through the window I can see my bike rig and anyone walking near it. The air is well-conditioned and the white-noise of the kids and people is fine for me. It reminds me of coding from a pub on a busy Friday night, one of my favorite things to do. 

In just 90 minutes I can fully recharge a 1.25 kWh power station grab a small bite, perhaps a coffee, refill my water bottles, check in with work for critical things, take a bathroom break, even take a small nap with my head on my hands (if it feels safe). Then, just around the time the coffee kicks in, I'm ready to hit the road to wherever I will be spending the next 24 to 48 hours.
