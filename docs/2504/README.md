# Should I live stream IRL again?

* I'm already for two 100G modems per month and would have to "buy out" to get out of it.
* How much do I care about stream quality?
* I am *not* going to manage two channels!
* Leave Instagram and Facebook for rwxrobfun (art and outdoors)
* Twitch, YouTube, Kick are all whatever
* Need to setup offline clips
* Action4 webcam chest mount with wind screens cabled to rear-rack bag
* Drive up to Two Gorges loop and check livestream-ness
* Just zone 2
* Gravel+ terrain maximum
* Can't let it seep into "streaming everything" again
* Sushi streams with "mystery guest"?
* Schedule?
