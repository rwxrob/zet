# Twitch Streamers Really Should Manage Ads Better

I'm pretty fucking annoyed by any streamer these days that forces me to
sit through a bunch of ads just to see the stream when there is
a perfectly easy way to stop pre-roll ads from appearing at all.

I mean, most of them just don't know about it, but is that an excuse?

I know I didn't and now I understand the frustration people were having
with the ads. It's not that Twitch forces ads on everyone, it's that the
streamers don't take the miniscule about of time it takes to manage them
correctly so that they appear when the stream all goes on a break and
doesn't do anything important during that time.

I'm going to have to make a video about this to spread the word to other
streamers.  Obviously, they can (and will) do whatever the fuck they
want. But I can at least make sure they are making a choice instead of
the default.
