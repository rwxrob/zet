# Actually, `podman` Might Be Better Than `docker`

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/NlDD3rQoooY>

1. `podman` only runs on Linux (used to be downside)
1. Beginners had to install Linux before using `podman`
1. Minikube is superior to Docker Desktop (for beginners)
1. Minikube requires a "driver"
1. VirtualBox one of drivers for minikube (best imho)
1. Minikube + VirtualBox = fully functional Linux (`mk ssh`)
1. This removes primary disadvantage of `podman` for beginners
1. Minikube *installs* `podman` (with `docker` name support)
1. `podman` seems to be keeping itself more current
1. `podman` is already aware of `cgroupsv2`
1. Minikube FTW! It gives you everything
