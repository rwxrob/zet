# Please Vote for Notification Twitch API Addition

Having the ability to lock the notification to the stream title would be
ideal, but even being able to change the notification text from the API
would save viewers from being misled by the notification when it gets
out of sync, or is so generic it doesn't convince people to click on it
and check the stream out.
