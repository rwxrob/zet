# True Learning from Master to Apprentice

There's a reason George Lucas put what he learned about learning from
his own master, Joseph Campbell, into that really popular movie he made.
Masters have been conveying their knowledge to apprentices since before
there were words for such things, always with the intent to empower the
one learning, to help them become not just independent learners, but
true autodidacts who actively plan their own learning path for the rest
of their lives, never ceasing to seek new opportunities to learn and
contribute to the world, leaving it better than when they entered it.
Learning is not only how we stay alive, but the reason for living: to
explore, discover, and protect that which we love.
