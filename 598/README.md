# Guido Realizes Python Sucks for Most Things

I really love Guido, I think we'd be friends in another life. Guy is
obsessed with parsing languages and PEG, and he has no problem throwing
his own creation under the bus so people don't use it for the wrong
things, which pretty much the whole fucking world has done with Python.

Python is abysmally bad for enterprise software and microservices,
that's why Go was created, specifically to replace "Python, Java, and
C++" at Google for highly concurrent microservices that require (as
Guido openly admits) require "a more disciplined approach". Learn Go.
Forget Python unless you must.
