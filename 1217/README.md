# I was So Wrong About Twitch Commands

I initially was bothered by the Twitch commands that begin with
exclamation point (!). I felt like they would take away from the
experience by spamming the chat, but they do the opposite, they promote
engagement and independence so that people can get their own answers and
help others to see those same answers without forcing them to pull up a
page, or at least provide a quick link to the exact page. 

Twitch commands are particularly important for coworking streams where
the streamer is not always available to answer questions and the others
in the chat would have a hard time repeating the same thing over and
over again to people just joining. This is mandatory to maintain any
level of engagement while really heads-down focusing on other things.
Plus, let's face it, it's more interactive and engaging than just
referring people to a page. By linking all the commands to other
commands you create a sort of story-game adventure gamified version of
your core information.

So yeah, I'm hooked. Now I just have to create my own bot so I can give
even more control including things like looking at my uptime and direct
system specifications. I mean, might as well use all the advantages of a
real-time interface.
