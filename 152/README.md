# MUDL Pedagogy: Multi-User Dungeon for Learning

I think I just invented one of the coolest acronyms of my life: ***MUDL***.

I've been struggling with how to capture and create content in the same
way that organic learning happens, which follows a graph model. I've
been trying to write the content in a very granular way that can be
recomposed into different forms and approached in a non-linear way.

As I was writing about ***learning nodes*** and compared them to 'Choose
Your Own Adventure' books and role playing I realized this is *exactly*
how Multi-User Dungeon text-based games have been developed for years.
Writers add on rooms and sections without affecting the others,
providing different paths into the new content without disrupting the
existing content. Why not follow this when generating learning content?
Why not make MUDs for Learning, or MUDLs?

Of course, all the plays on this word became immediately obvious.
Psypheric1 has the best one so far (at the top). I just love that I can
now very succinctly describe my writing style and approach:

Me: "I'm writing a MUDL to help beginners enter the tech sector."  
Them: "What's a MUDL?"  
Me: "It's a Multi-User Distributed Learning system."

Hell, we could even allow people learning in the system to opt-in to
display themselves in a "room", we could even play up the "escape room"
idea and everyone in the room is helping the rest to "escape" on to the
next "learning room." 

This idea is so good I almost want to throw out the term ***learning
node*** and replace it with "escape room" so that people can visualize
their learning process even more.
