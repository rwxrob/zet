# Proxmox as ISO or Application on Debian

When I asked what is the best base OS to install for a "home lab" full
of old hardware virtualized into a "home cloud" the answers were varied
but my favorite seems to be Proxmox which comes as either an ISO
installable image that you can flash to a thumb drive, or as an
application that can be installed onto any Debian-based system. Since I
definitely want Linux as a base OS for all my hardware, this makes the
most sense.

I'm hearing rave reviews from very knowledgable people in the community
who have this working for everything they do from home.
