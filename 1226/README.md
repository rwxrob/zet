# How Fucking Stupid is NeoVim Removing `view`

NeoVim has been a frequently point of "conversation" this last week and
I just had a critical need to open a bunch of test files that I wanted
to be sure not to accidentally mess with, you know, the absolute perfect
use case for `view`. But, NeoVim team that that was optional and
actively ripped that out. That how fucking stupid they are.
