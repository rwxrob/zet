# Bash Allows Dash in Function Names, POSIX Doesn't

Just got burned by a Bash-ism (that might also be a Kourne Shell thing).
I know that you can use kebab-case with command names, but function
names must not have dashes in them, unless it is Bash. I actually prefer
it to underscores (which is rare). Oh well, back to underscores, which
are far more common in everything.
