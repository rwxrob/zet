# Use EdgeDeflector for Chrome Windows Searches

The main annoyance with PopOS that send me back to Windows for my desktop OS
was the removal of system searching from the Super/Windows key. It's there,
just nerfed significantly and no longer combined with viewing everything open
and running. So I was overjoyed to discover how quick and simple searching with
the Windows key is in Windows these days, even more so when I discovered
EdgeDeflector that automatically opens Chrome instead of Edge when a search
doesn't hit on something locally.

This is the same as Command + Space on a Mac. 

It's a search-centric world and those who learn it will dominate in
productivity (or have more time for family, games, or hacking).

By the way, Microsoft tried to block it, yet another reason not to use Windows 11.
