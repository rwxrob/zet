# iTerm Really is Better

Lately I've had to use a Mac Pro for work and when remote doing personal
work. (I'm actually writing this from my Mac laptop right now even though
it's being streamed from my Linux machine through the miracle of `ssh`
and `tmux`.) When I tried to use the new default terminal on the Mac I
was very disappointed to realize they have totally fucked up the
scrollbar and that it leaves residual artifacts at the end of every
line. Perhaps the reason no one has fixed it is because the first thing
most serious Mac users do is install iTerm.

Once upon a time I installed iTerm and it was horrible. But that has all
changed. It is really amazing now. That's all. I want to make sure that
people know about it rather than suffer.
