# VirtualBox Does Not Run on Windows 11 or Mac M1

According to the official VirtualBox representative answering questions
about M1 support on Mac, neither M1 nor Windows 11 is supported. This
leaves VMware as the only other main option. Some report getting QEMU to
work as well, but it is not a process for beginners --- at all.
