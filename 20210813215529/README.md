# Q: Do you have a favorite OS?

It often doesn't make sense to have a favorite. Use what you have and
make the best of it.

My criteria are very different from most?

* Which gets me a bash command line terminal as fast as possible?
* Which has the easiest and most used package management? 
* Which has the most ethical main FOSS sponsors?

No longer criteria *for me*:

* Which has the best community?
* Which provides the best build environment? 
* Which has the most current software and library release cycle?
* I HATE distro hopping. I have shit to do.

Actually, the OS that just makes me giddy when I hear about it right
now (although I would never made it my main workstation OS) is Alpine:

* Contains zero GPLv3
* Supper minimal, but not *too* minimal
* Kiss ass package manager
* Caters to embedded and containers
