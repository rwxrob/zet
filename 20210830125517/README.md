# Web People Don't Know How to Use Language

The terms "frontend", "backend", and "full-stack" were either invented
or destroyed by web people, people who should know better than to pick
obtuse, open-ended terms for things. After all these people claim to be
be in charge of producing our Web content. Perhaps that is why the Web
is so totally messed up these days. Web people have a bad habit of
taking a term that has perfectly good meaning and obfuscating the crap
out of it. 

They also gave us the terms "serverless" and warped "API" into meaning
*only* a "Web API" because the entire world and tech industry revolves
around them, or so they think. 

It took moronic web think to bring us the Google term "Site Reliability
Engineer" displacing the perfectly accurate term "Systems Administrator"
(which, by the way, *already* implied someone who could script and code
before Google decided that was the greatest distinguishing difference)
and now we can't even search for jobs without using this idiotic,
inaccurate terminology. 

Perhaps this is why Linus Torvalds refuses to call these people
"developers." I certainly don't blame him. They sure *the hell* are not
engineers, more like a bunch of one-trick ponies who have no real idea
how computers even work and feel all powerful using Typescript instead
of JavaScript.

What? Are you offended that Linus and I have used inaccurate terms to
describe what you do? Get used to it. You are the dregs of the IT
industry. You deserve it.
