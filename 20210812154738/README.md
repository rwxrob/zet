# ZettelMark, EzMark + Video and Tags Lines

ZettelMark is EzMark (essentially simplified CommonMark with GFM tables)
with the following semantic additions

## Video Line

```markdown
# First Line Title, Followed by Blank Line

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/<id>

First paragraph starts here ...
```

* Must be third line beginning with television emoji (ðŸ“º)
* Must have one space following emoji, then URL with `<>`
* Must be followed by blank line

## Tags Line

* Must be last line
* Must start with 4 or more spaces plus `#`
* Only hashtags (no whitespace) separated by single space
* Avoid redundant tags when content itself would suffice

## Zettel Links

While encouraging the reader to use a browser that will allow searching
of *any* word that appears in a zettel, sometimes it remains a good idea
to provide a direct link to a specific zettel.

* Use the `isosec` zettel ID wrapped in slashes (`/`)
