# Git Learning Resources

Here's a collection of resources that I personally prefer to recommend
for learning Git. The most important was what was recommended to me in
the Summer of 2021: `man gittutorial`. It is spectacular and I learned
things live that other `git` veterans did not know (such as `switch`
because the `gittutorial` is always kept up to date. 

But there are other fun resources as well.
