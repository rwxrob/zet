# Jupyter Data Science Image (Stack) has No `bc`

The `bc` command, arguably the most important math-related command in
all of UNIX, has not been included in any of the "Data Science" standard
Jupyter container images. 

This really brings home my frustration with the data and Python people
who don't fully grok how powerful UNIX/Linux is all by itself.
Obviously, they prefer to do all that type of stuff in Python itself.
But to purposefully remove what has been a standard command for more
than three decades just shows the amount of cluelessness from this
otherwise very intelligent community.
