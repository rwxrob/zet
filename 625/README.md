# Learn to Shell Script *Before* Customizing

As I'm reading through *The Linux Command Line* (from William Shotts)
and I get to the part about "customizing your prompt" the first thing
that jumps out to me is the `PS=...` line without any explanation of wht
the `=` is doing or even what a fucking variable is. That's just wrong.
Learning to shell script is *not* hard --- especially POSIX shell
scripting. Learn to edit files, then shell script, then customize all
the things. You'll be happier you did.
