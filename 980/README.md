# Rob's Personal Code of Conduct

I know I fail miserably to keep it. But having it written down helps me
remember. Often I have to repeat these to myself over and over again to
help remember in the heat of the moment. Obviously, this is not an
exhaustive list, but it sure helps. Sometimes I will tweak it.

0.  Ask
1.  Run
2.  Yoga
3.  Chill
4.  Dance
5.  Create
6.  Forgive
7.  Consider
8.  Never fear
9.  Be grateful
10. Use a filter
11. Swear better
12. Make it count
13. Foster dialog
14. Live with less
15. Show and share
16. Let people change
17. Build useful things
18. Boil the fucking water
19. Don’t get mad, get busy
20. Read the fucking manual
21. “What if everybody did it?”
22. Give the benefit of the doubt
23. Remind your body you are human

When I find myself doing the following I know I'm on the path to evil:

* Fear
* Chase the likes
* Teach and preach
* Assume malintent
* Sugar the learning
* Build clever things
* Wonder what people think of me
* Ask, "What can I get away with?"
