# My Pomodoro Timer

I'm always changing my duration on my Pomodoro timer. The "standard" is
25 minutes with five minute breaks and a fifteen minute break every 4
sessions, but that doesn't always work out with meetings and coding
sessions. In fact, there's good science that contradicts the conclusion
to always use 25 minutes, that it can break an otherwise amazing flow
state in the middle. I'm going with top of the hour starting sessions
and 15 minute breaks before the next hour starts. That's enough time to
do some sun salutations, take some notes about what was accomplished,
and make coffee. The 25/5 thing is just way to ADD for me.

In fact, in `pomo` tool I'll be building in different modes:

* Scheduled mode that uses a set schedule
* Spontaneous mode that just starts when you start it

There will be configuration settings to manage the durations and
intervals:

* `duration.session` (default: 4)
* `duration.break.short` (default: 25m)
* `duration.break.long` (default: 35)
* `sessions.per.block` (default: 4)
