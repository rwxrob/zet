# Zettelkasten Feeling of Freedom

There's something really freeing about following the Zettelkasten
method. It just seems like it syncs so well with my thought process
already. I feel zero guilt writing about whatever I feel like at the
moment and know that I have the possibility to draw out all the
connections (and publications) from that content.

There's also something freeing about knowing that I can do searches any
time --- from the command line or the amazing graphic [search index] on
GitHub --- to get to what I need.
