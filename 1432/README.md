# "Everybody reads the bindings, so it's important."

Yeah, I'm so not a Twit fan. As the host examines his guest's bookshelf,
commenting on each one, he says, "I really like your set" and then,
"everybody reads the bindings, so it's important." I realized how
stupid it is to manage false perception with a "set" in the
fucking background. 

You know this type of guy, the type who very carefully speaks in
a specific way because he's on a radio show, who deliberately puts
certain things on his set that have nothing to do with him just because
he knows his audience will "appreciate" it. I fucking hate that. 

Why the fuck do so many people have such a fucking problem being
authentic?!

I don't have a fucking set. I put a few posters up and some masks. The
rest is all just exactly who I am, including my laundry. People paying
attention will see that most people are *done* with perception managers
and Fyre festival influencers.  If someone would think differently of me
if I didn't have all that, fuck 'em.
