# Use `x_` Instead of `command_` in bash Template

Yeah, after more than two weeks coding on stuff using `command_` instead
of the `x_` original command function identifier prefix in my bash
projects I'm shaking my head wondering what I was thinking. So from now
on `x.` in any code I write means that the function is 'exported'. By
the way, no more exported but 'hidden' functions `x__`, those create
ambiguous dependencies that I don't want to promote.
