# Use `x.` Instead of `command_` in bash Template

Yeah, after more than two weeks coding on stuff using `command_` instead
of the `x_` original command function identifier prefix in my bash
projects I'm shaking my head wondering what I was thinking. While
migrating back to `x_` I tried `x.` having discovered that using dots is
perfectly find in names when I did that for adding config tab
completion. So from now on `x.` in any code I write means that the
function is 'exported'.
