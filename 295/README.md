# Alsa Mixer Capture Set to 33 Gain

Need to remember that my setup requires a gain of no more than 33 from
`alsamixer` (Capture). The one to the left is corresponds to the top
right (line in). I'm doing an analog loop back.

I realized that after using Webex meeting today all my sounds settings
got fucked up. I was unplugging shit looking for interference and
everything. Sometimes I am so grateful just just works. It was a good
reminder what is actually all connected up and how. I haven't looked at
it in more than a year.
