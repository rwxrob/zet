# Why not NeoVim (`nvim`)?

NeoVim is absolute shit made by people who should have never even
created it in the first place. I fucking hate it, like [*really*] hate it.
It has made ever wrong decision possible. It is a living testament to
the reason Bram hates dealing with potential contributors who would put
all the dumb crap into Vim if allowed. All I can say is God bless Bram
Moolenaar.

And can you believe the NeoVim assholes decided to have a "VimConf"
without even asking Bram if they can use his trademark? Tells you
everything you need to know about that shitty, clueless community.
