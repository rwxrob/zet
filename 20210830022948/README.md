# Learning is Non-Linear

Every single one of us is following our own path. It's how life works.
Different choices lead to different outcomes, like a "choose your own
adventure" book or a role-playing game where the experience and rewards
are real, if you work for them. Building one skill unlocks several
others, all with dependencies on the original. It's up to you to build
your own skills tree based on your interests, abilities, and
opportunities.
