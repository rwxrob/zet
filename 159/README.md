# Q: What is the best team-building activity?

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/ubwxVmM-5WU>

* Anything with food (and beer)
* What about being remote?
  * Consider bringing everybody together once or twice
  * GitLab does it right
* Put faces and stuff in your avatars
* Just video conferencing is *not* enough
