# Promoting Attribution by Saying "Fuck"

The more I litter my otherwise tame content with swears (like "fuck"),
the more I will at least have some satisfaction knowing that the people
who inevitably steal it and use it without any attribution (and believe
me they do) will have to at least spend some time, and perhaps feel some
minor annoyance, as they senselessly plagiarize it with a smile to make it
more presentable to those they would have think it is their own.

Do I need to use swears?

No.

Am I capable of discovering and using much more intelligent language?

Fuck yeah! But why? I now have another reason not to (oh GOD, a dangling
preposition, now that is 100 times worse than unnecessary profanity, but
what the hell).

Besides, it's hard for me to trust someone who looks at me differently
for fucking swearing in my personal writings and streams. I love that to
some it makes me look "unhinged" (a word recently used by a
happy-clueless person on Twitter to describe me).

If you have a fucking problem with my god-damn overuse of works like
shit, Jesus, and *damn* (not necessarily in that order) then get the
fuck out and let me be. I got shit to do.

*Obviously, I don't talk this way at work unless I know exactly who I'm
speaking with. I also tend to write profanity much more frequently than
I speak it in conversation, for some reason. This rant is about my
personal life, which includes these personal notes.*
