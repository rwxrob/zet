# How do you take notes like that?

I use my interpretation of the [Zettelkasten Method][zk] on GitHub. This
is a part of the [Beginner Boost][b] where I discuss taking notes in
general as a part of the `W` (writing) from the [RWX Method][rwx]. 90%
of all writing that I do falls into this method now and I'm in the
process of converting everything I've ever written into one of about a
dozen searchable, shareable, and flexible Zettelkasten repos.
