# Titles for Technologists

Titles are meant to provide a grouping of skills and knowledge. They
aren't really certifications, but serve the same purpose
organizationally.

* Autodidact
* Technologist
* Shell Native 
* Cloud Native
* LANG Coder (knows the essentials)
* LANG Programmer (knows all of the language)
* LANG Developer (has built substantial software with)
* Hacker
* Engineer

The scope would be locked down by the list of requirements at some
point. The Autodidact, Technologist, and Shell Native titles are covered
by the Beginner Boost along with Bash Coder, C Coder, and Go Coder.
They'll cover some of Cloud Native and a tiny bit of Hacker.

I'm down with people calling themselves "RWX Hackers" "RWX Engineers".
I'm a little concerned people will drop the qualifying *RWX* from the
beginning thinking they are whatever they think the world has decided
for that particular title. A "Boost Hacker" could be just someone who
has written enough C to use an exploit tool on it and understand why it
is broken and how to break it. While a "Hacker" in the world-wide sense
would automatically having people wonder what kind of qualifications a
person has to say that.
