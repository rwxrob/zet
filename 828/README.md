# Computers are Not Just for Our Entertainment

Computers were created to *compute* and people paid \$100/hour just to
use one. These days we don't even use computers for any of those same
reasons. Computers have become glorified televisions and gaming systems
and people somehow think learning "web development" is the place to
start. I know I did. But that's just not true. And not even the way I
learned growing up. We need to learn to use computers for their most
valuable purpose, to help us do the hard stuff of improving all of our
lives in a serious way. (And sure, we can play during the breaks).
