# Kind and Minikube Effectively Do NOT Support Podman

The errors and warnings are clear. No Kind or Minikube for you if you
only have `podman` installed. I wish everyone would just figure this
shit out and create a best-of approach. I doubt anything will happen
anytime soon.

Also, I'm starting to thing, after the massive failures we had
attempting to use `cri-o` at work in place of Docker, that `cri-o` is a
steaming pile of shit with flies buzzing all around it that love to
write blog posts about how awesome it is.
