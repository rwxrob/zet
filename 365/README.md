# Pretty Sure I Invented Word: isosec

Here's an *isosec*:

I've never heard anyone else use the word and someone asked about it, so
I got to thinking. I'm pretty sure I invented it.

While working on KEG and PEGN I needed a unique identifier beyond all
the cool ones I'd codified in my `uniq` Bonzai branch. I had one
criterion that none of the others could fulfill: it had to be something
I could generate with nothing more than a watch or clock on the wall.
The current second was the obvious choice, combined with something
associating it with a give scope, easy enough with a prefix. But how
could the second be the same everywhere? It wasn't immediately obvious
to me, but using the GMT (ISO) time was the clear solution. And thus was
born the term "isosec" that I started using everywhere. I suppose
"gmtsec" would work as well, but not as pleasant to say.
