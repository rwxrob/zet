# WARNING: DO NOT BUY "Mastering Go" (It is Shit)

I should have known better than to expect anything good from Packt
Publishing, but this book said it covered Generics and relatively recent
so I went for it. I could not be more sorry. Mihalis seems like a nice
enough Go programmer, just one with very poor decision making skills
about what to put into a published book about Go. The generics in it are
DEAD WRONG and are based on an ancient spec. It is really going to fuck
up a lot of people. The other stuff in there is nice and all, there are
a bunch of recipes for different things, but nothing I would ever pay
money for. There are far better examples of all of those things just on
GitHub that you can just read through. In fact, this whole thing has
reminded me that the single best way to learn Go is not from a fucking
book. READ ACTUAL CODE!! Find a great project and study the shit out of
it. In fact, there's nothing better than the standard Go library itself.
It is chuck full of great patterns, idioms, and style and was created by
some of the best Go veterans alive (none of whom have made any books,
btw).
