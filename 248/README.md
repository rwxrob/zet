# Trump Morons Taking Over Twitter Hashtags

Lately a lot of the trending stuff on Twitter is pro-Trump, moreso than
when Trump was President. Things like `#TrumpWasRight` trending just
prove that the people who support him are still as useless as ever, they
just don't have anything to do now. The rest of the world who were on
Twitter during those years have left Twitter to get shit done now. Only
the unemployed, angry, idiots remain with nothing more to do than post
shit and twitter and try to get a hashtag to take off. I haven't even
looked at the news practically at all since the end of the election, not
even the comedy versions of it. I asked around, and I'm not the only
productive, working-class, intelligent person who radically changed
their time on Twitter since that time. That's why those idiots are
trending on Twitter. The rest of us are actual being productive members
of society. Nothing proclaims how *fucking* stupid you are today than
saying you *still* support Trump. Thank god for that filter. You cannot
justify support for him at any level at this point and not prove to the
world that you serious problems with reality and critical thinking.
