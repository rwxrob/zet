# Ideas for SKILSTAK Books to Write

* Activate Your Autodidact, Learn Like the Best
* Become a Shell Native, Conquer the Command Line
* Just Enough Networking
* Polyglot Programmer: Learn to Code in Go, Python, and Javascript

These books will cover all of the material from the annual SKILSTAK
Beginner Boost, which runs every year between May the 4th and August
20th (about eight weeks (or 40 hours) total). The books will be
completely free online as Pandoc Markdown file and as PDFs under the "No
Derivative Works" Creative Commons license. People are free to have
their own dissenting opinions --- even dangerous ones --- but I do not
want to enable them by having them steal my book and change just the
parts with which they disagree. You get it all (for free) or nothing.
That's the entire point of choosing a book format in the first place.

I suppose these titles are now copyrighted. And I suppose putting
this out on Twitter and in GitHub will be the first step to eventually
publishing them. Polyglot Programmer already has the first two chapters
finished. Just found them in my old SKILSTAK stuff and they are pretty
damn good. I think it failed in the classroom because we didn't have
enough time and the teens were too distracted to focus enough to get
through the material, but the organization is very sound.

I thought of having these books be a collaborative effort and getting
them published through a community, but that defeats what has become
obvious to me is the single greatest advantage of any book: a singular
voice and tone. I will have people contribute to the editing and such
and be sure to list them on the collaborators or credits page, but the
book will be from me as the sole author. Hopefully, it will inspire
others to take up writing their own as well.
