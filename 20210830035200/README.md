# You Cannot Learn Linux on Services Like REPL.it

Services like <https://replit.com> provide an important need for those
who are forced to use iPads to code, but they are not sufficient to
learn Linux, or even to learn to *really* code on Linux using modern
methods that depend on containers. Why? Here are some reasons:

* Cannot install software
* Cannot use containers
* Limited resources
* Limited number of commands
* Not reliable, sustainable
* Slow and lossy connections
* Experimentation limited
* Just not real

That last reason is the most important. Even though you are running
Linux from a container spun up on their servers and every key stroke you
make into their terminal emulator is directly sent to that servers
terminal handler, at the end of the day, it's not real. Having a sandbox
might be nice if you have no access to a server of your own remotely,
but there is no value beyond this trivial need. To learn enough to even
call yourself a beginner you have to have a *real* Linux system on a
computer *you* control.
