# Hi, I'm Rob (rwxrob.tv)

It's always hard writing one's own profile. For now, you can get to know
about me best by dropping in on <http://rwxrob.tv>. I'm live pretty much
all day every day doing different things. For a more exhaustive
background about me you can check out my GitHub profile, which includes
by full curriculum vitae (resume). I don't have a LinkedIn (and never
will). I do have a personal code of conduct that I fail to live up to
constantly, but I try to live by it as best I can.

Perhaps the best thing anyone has ever said about me professionally came
in an unsolicited email from a professional who vetted and helped hire
one member of my community after he landed a starting job for over \$100,
000 after having qualified and won a competitive internship opportunity,
and then went on to win over all the other interns for the position:

     Clearly, you have a talent for educating people in tech. … After
     [your member’s] success [here], I suspect the review team will be
     even more interested in picking up one or two of your students. We’
     ve had a lot of very bright interns from some of the top
     universities in the country and [your community member] was right
     in the mix with the best of them.

This candidate had nothing but a Psychology degree and strong will to
learn. He had never heard the word "Linux" before he met me and landed
a job doing comprehensive applications development in several languages
for the Linux version of their application, one of the top 10
applications in the cloud-native and data space today.
