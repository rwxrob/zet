# GitHub Zettelkasten Live Commit Notifications

If a person has their web browser open on your Zettelkasten GitHub repo
--- even in the background --- and you commit to it while they have it
open it will send a system notification containing the commit message.
This allows people to follow you in real-time if they so desire.

There's no way I would put that level of notification on Twitter. It's
the very reason I keep several ZK repos rather than a monolith. People
don't want to be bombarded with *all* my notifications, only the ones
they want. By using GitHub in this way the *user* can tune how much spam
they want to get from me in a granular fashion.

And *none* of that had to be built. It already exists and is a benefit
from hosting your ZK repos on GitHub. I could not be more pleased. This
has saved me hundreds of hours. I really need to write this all up, make
a video, then pitch for a GitHub presentation about it: *GitHub for
Knowledge Management with Zettelkasten*
