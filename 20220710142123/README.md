# Streaming Guidebook Ideas

It seems like a book focused on the types of streaming and the "kits"
and setup for each is still very much needed. For some reason, streamers
frequently don't share this information and when they do it is
"unpopular" or sparse. Turns out, on YouTube posting stuff about your
"rig" can "throw off the algorithm" causing your content to not be
pushed in front of the audience you want (something I learned watching
a MB streamer).
