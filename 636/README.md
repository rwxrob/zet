1. I actually funded my own SKILSTAK business using retirement
1. Self-funding gives you freedom
1. Personal ownership is very valuable
1. Prefer and recommend becoming a contract (free-agent with strings)
1. It's very personal, for better or worse
1. Don't do personal favors
1. It is very hard, be ready
1. You probably won't have insurance (in America)
1. Honestly, just get a cushy corporate gig and do stuff on the side
1. Moonlight instead
