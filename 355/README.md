# You *MUST* Learn Vi/m for Cloud-Native

Seriously, all day today I have been in and out of Kubernetes nodes
using `vi` the whole time. While it is true that all of these nodes have
an NAS drive attached that I can be coding in from another TMUX window
and just change windows back over, it is immensely convenient that I
know `vi` and *not* `emacs` or VSCode or Neo(fucking)Vim. I was
softening on my position about `vi` after discovering the
containerization making your editor less important, but the truth is,
seriously, you cannot call yourself a "cloud-native" anything --- let
alone "infrastructure" or "SRE" --- without *mastering* `vi` and then
`vim`. Such people in such careers should be dismissed on the spot for
having a single fucking line of Lua in their `.vimrc`. People who want
to play around and develop apps are, of course, fine, but not the people
who do what I and most of the rest of the operations careers are doing
every fucking day. Sorry, not sorry. I'm actually pissed that I allowed
myself to soften on this point. This entire day has been absolute,
objective evidence that this job *demands* `vi` skills.
