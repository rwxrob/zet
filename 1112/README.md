# Isosec to the Rescue for IRL Streaming

It's become more and more obvious that I need an app, or even just a
device, that let's me press a button and pushes the isosec onto the end
of an array. Then I can take this list of timestamps and jump to them in
whatever recording I am doing based on the beginning timestamp of the
recording. I envision a tiny device I could clip someplace or put in my
pocket and just click without anyone noticing. I would get in the habit
of just clicking it when something interesting in an IRL stream happens
but without saying anything at that point, just knowing that is
something I want to jump to later so I don't have to slog through the
entire video (which could be as long as seven hours in some cases).

I suppose for now I could just add a `!m` command or set all caps `MARK`
in the chat and then mine them out. I mean, I already have a chat bot of
sorts just because WeeChat is logging everything to files. I need to
rewrite noalbs in Go anyway, so I will add that eventually. The
advantage of using MARK is that I can actually include some text right
after that when I'm able to speak into the phone (DankChat).
