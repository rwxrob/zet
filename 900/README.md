# We Have to Learn What We Like

Empowerment is useless without drive. Discovering what drives us, what
our desires are, is a fundamental part of our learning. It's not enough
to learn what our abilities and opportunities are, we have to discover
what it is we want to do with them, what we desire. You can be the most
gifted mathematician ever born and hate doing it. Such a person must
discover what activities they enjoy that doing math allows them to do.
