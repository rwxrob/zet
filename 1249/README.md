# Prevent Deletion of Twitch Videos with Highlights

Twitch will delete any video (VOD) created after 60 days for Amazon
Prime subscribers, even if that video is a part of a collection, which
is really too bad because that original video has all the marks and
clips tied to it. The only way around the deletion is to create a
"highlight" of the entire video changing the icon next to it in the
Video Producer from "Highlight" to "Watch". Then add the highlighted
videos to any collection.
