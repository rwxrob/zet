# Ubuntu/PopOS Fix for `libvirt` and `virt-manager`

üòÉ *Big thanks to @chomkyseal from our Twitch community.*

First make sure you add your user to `libvirt` group and logout and log
back in. You'll know because `groups` will list it and you'll be able to
create VMs using `virt-manager` without any other major changes.

Set `/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf` with following:

```
group = "libvirt"
```

Set `~/.config/libvirt/libvirt.conf` (local user home directory) with
following:

```
uri_default = "qemu:///system"
```

Set `/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf` with following:

```
unix_sock_group = "libvirt"
unix_sock_ro_perms = "0777"
unix_sock_rw_perms = "0770"
auth_unix_ro = "none"
auth_unix_rw = "none"
```

Others have reported that disabling the `security_driver` in
`/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf`:

```
security_driver = "none"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è  ***MAKE SURE YOU `sudo systemctl stop libvirtd` and `sudo systemctl start libvirtd` to be absolutely sure it restarts.***
