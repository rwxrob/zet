# Amazon East Failure == Centralization Fails

Hey look, Amazon is proving (like so many other before) that
centralizing all our main services on one or three providers is a
*fucking bad idea*. Eventually, these idiots will wake up and realize
that decentralization has *always* been the answer (but everyone somehow
forgot that). It is the reason the Internet and DNS and things like it
were designed the way they were. Thankfully, people are waking up to
this stupidity and working on any number of decentralized
architectures. Also, machine learning is pushing the tolerances of
enterprises world-wide causing them to rethink their decisions to put
things in the cloud. This is why Amazon and others are pushing hard to
promote their 'on prem' offerings because, well, they are 
stupid, just greedy.
