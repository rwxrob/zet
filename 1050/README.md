# Search-Centric Editing with Vim

I've been using the term "search-centric" for a while now (not sure if
other people like to use it or have). To me that means that you are
always thinking --- not of the shortcut or hotkey to use --- but of the
terms and characters and unique spans of text that will get you where
you want to be. Whether it be the next letter in the line a few words away
that I want to get to, or cut to, or delete to, or it is something in
the header of a Markdown file, I can use the `/` for more anything and
the `t` for stuff in the line.

This is why it is *so* critical to create a Markdown basic syntax of
one-best-ways of doing things and sticking with it so that you can
reliably identify, say, all the horizontal rules `----` or headings
`^##` or days of a schedule that have been linked with anchors. This
allows ridiculously easy editing and repetition when combined with `n`
(to find the next one) and `.` (to repeat).
