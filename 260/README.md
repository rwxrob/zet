# Windows VirtualBox Fails for Boost

Got a Windows machine running in a VirtualBox virtual machine but it is
unable to install Docker Personal (formerly Docker Desktop) because of
the convoluted hyper-visor requirements. This means that I won't be able
to demonstrate how to install Docker Personal without a capture card
setup or a separate video on that. It's so sticking easy that it really
isn't needed. I'm going to leave the details of installing Docker
Personal completely out of the Boost other than to mention that
participants have to do it before starting Week 1 (which is another good
reason to have a week 0).
