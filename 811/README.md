1. I think we need to explore them
1. I wish crypto people where more authentic
   1. "Crypto is going to liberate the poor from the bondage of fiat currency"
   1. Usually they are not really socio-economic reform
   1. Lied to us about "ordering pizza"
   1. Flipped to say "it's about being the new gold"
   1. It's about power (while wallet creators fight over)
   1. "Every 12 year old should be able to create their currency."
1. What if everybody did it?
   1. More than half the world could not participate
   1. Not enough power in the world to handle it
1. Proof of Stake is interesting (to me)
1. Blockchain algorithm is fundamentally flawed
