# We All Have Different Abilities and Opportunities

We all start out life with more or less the same basic skills. We cry
when we're hungry, suckle our mother's breast, turn our head and look at
where those interesting sounds came from, smile or giggle when something
seems funny, and, eventually, learn to crawl.

> Ever notice how differently kids learn to crawl, some use both legs,
> some just use one knee and look like a crab. From our earliest days we
> build our own skills tree, our own learning path.

What distinguishes us as individuals is our abilities and opportunities.
Some are born into single-parent homes, others with silver spoons. Some
have a difficult time seeing anything in the next room but can solve
complex puzzles faster than most. Some have dexterity allowing them to
move in amazing ways, while others struggle to walk at all. We are all
very different.

We had no idea what our abilities and opportunities were when we were
first born. Life is about discovering and developing them into skills
that carry us through existence doing whatever we ultimately decide is
worth our short time here on Earth. We don't get to pick our abilities
and opportunities, but we can choose what to do with what we've been
given.
