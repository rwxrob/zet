# Good Morning: Friday, November 19, 2021

* Tonight is full moon and lunar eclipse
* Saturday is IRL Charlotte Art (Doris' Studio)
* Sunday picking up trash IRL

What did I do?

* Found several more bugs with Helm
* Concluded that there is no standard K8S application installation
* Revisited justification for not using Helm
* Explored flattening *everything* into just `kubectl apply`

What am I going to do?

* Attempt to flatten Helm charts (Node Feature Discovery, JupyterHub)
* Testing the premise than "package management" is a fail
* Walk and talk (Lion's route)
