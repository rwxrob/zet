# Learning is the Reason for Living

Learning is the one constant amidst all the variables of our
collective existence. We are all here to learn. From the day of our
birth we cannot escape it. Learn, adapt, or die.

We all start out life with more or less the same skills (or lack
thereof). It's our abilities and opportunities that differ. Life is
about discovering what they are and learning to make the most of them.
Some are born into single-parent homes, others with silver spoons. Some
struggle to walk or see but can solve complex puzzles faster than most.
We don't get to pick our abilities and opportunities, but we can choose
what to do with what we've been given.
