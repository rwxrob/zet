# The Distinctly Unsexy Advantage of Git-Bash

Look, Git-Bash (Git-SCM), the very old and stable original way to do
`git` on Windows (since it requires bash and, yes, perl) is *still* the
best shell for Windows. It gives you all the high-priority things you
love about bash:

* Keep scripting in bash
* Search your Windows filesystem with `find`
* Easily manage your `$PATH` without GUI
* Built in `git` and `ssh`

Git-Bash doesn't try to be more than it is. It's just bash with git in
in. It's not some convoluted, fucked-up attempt to unify the filesystems
of Linux and Windows together while consuming the resources of a full
(but buggy) virtual machine line WSL2 does. It just gives you enough
bash to avoid posh so that you can ssh into a *real* Linux system.
