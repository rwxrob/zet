# Don't Use `MANPAGER` for `less` Color

You might be able to get it to work, but my option using the `LESS*`
environment variables works on every release of `less` since the
beginning on every system that supports it. `MANPAGER` option clearly
does not. 

By the way, it was an Arch user who pushed for this completely
incompatible alternative. Figures.
