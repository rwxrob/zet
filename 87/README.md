# Limiting Zettel Titles to 52 Characters Great Win

Originally, I limited the title of all zettels to 52 characters simple
because I didn't want them to get trimmed by the commit comment and not
appear as the commit message that gets listed with the directory name in
GitHub, but it has turned out to be extremely helpful for a number of
unanticipated reasons:

1. Leaves lots of room for links and tag when posting
1. Fits easily onto 80 column screen with identifier
1. Forces succinct titles and focused zettel content
1. Works easily with `git commit`
1. Fits nicely within a graphic bubble when mind-mapping
1. Punishes the bombastic among us (including myself)
