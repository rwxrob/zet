# Bonzai AI for CLI, Remove Diseased GetOpt Brain

We live in an AI world. Everything is getting smart about completion. We
type emails that predict what our next sentence will be. We play games
that make intelligent decisions about or hero builds. We even complete
our very code while writing it with the best possible version of what we
are thinking about writing. Why then wouldn't we want to embrace AI for
our terminal command line interactions, UNIX, Linux, PowerShell,
whatever?

Bonzai supports intelligent, dynamic completion based on the specific
leaf commands Completer function. That could be the standard completion
(`comp-cmd`) or `comp-file` or `comp-calc` or `comp-cal` or `comp-week`
but even cooler than that, it could be `comp-ai` which includes an AI
trained model in the possible command completion, all from just tapping
`<tab>`. Why the fuck would anyone want `getopt` shit over that? And,
why would they clutter up a perfectly beautiful, speakable command line
with that shit?

The answer to why is because they still have a diseased GetOpt zombie
brain and haven't opened their minds up to the new world of intelligent,
intelligible command lines, command line completers that are as smart as
the best AI humans can provide, and eventually, perhaps, as smart as us.
Soon our AI Bonzai completers will be guessing what commands we want to
use based on the time of day and the weather. It's not fantasy. It's all
fucking possible, today. (Time for me to learn more Go machine learning.)
