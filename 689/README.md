# Difference Between Coder, Programmer, Developer, Engineer

It seems everyone has a different idea of what the terms *coder*,
*programmer*, and *developer* actually mean. In fact, even the United
States Bureau of Labor Statistics has their own idea. Here's what the
terms mean to me.

A ***coder*** is anyone who writes code and knows the essentials. This
includes code that is not (usually) considered programming like HTML,
CSS, JSON, YAML, etc.

A ***programmer*** programs, meaning they are given a task and create
the algorithms and write the code to execute them. This term denotes
ability to use at least one specific programming language. Usually, no
formal training is implied by this title. Reading a good book and
working on a few projects is sufficient.

A ***software developer*** (as the BLS states) is someone who *designs*
the applications and dictates what patterns, languages, and code will be
required from the programmers and coders on the project. This involves
a level of informed creativity that happens higher than programming.
This is highest paid title because it requires higher knowledge of data
structures, algorithms, enterprise business patterns, and
domain-specific industry knowledge. You don't need a CS degree for this,
but it usually helps.

A ***software engineer*** is someone who not only possesses software
developer skills --- including mastery of data structures and algorithms
--- but is fundamentally applying them to systems-level engineering.
Usually, this means the person has a masters STEM degree (or equivalent
learning). I have no problem calling a NASA scientist writing code for
spacecraft a "software engineer" (the origin of the term) but calling
a React JavaScript programmer an "engineer" is just wrong and, frankly,
disrespectful.
