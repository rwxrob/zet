# Don't use `read -p`, It's Not POSIX

I've loved `read -p` so much that I really cannot deny that I tricked my
brain into thinking it was POSIX. It's just not. I'm really enjoying my
(re)discovery of `shellcheck` to help me out with the full year of
Bash-isms I allowed myself to learn and use (and now seriously regret,
sort of). POSIX or Perl or Python or Go, that's my new take. Seeing all
the stuff in containers I'm more convinced that POSIX is the only shell
scripting anyone should write when working with the new cloud-native
landscape.
