# PowerShell is Definitely Worth Learning

I cannot believe I actually just wrote those words, but even if you only
rarely use a Windows machine, learning PowerShell will make your
experience much less annoying. In other words, PowerShell saves you from
having to learn the GUI equivalent, which is almost always either
confusing or just broken. It was just such an experience that convinced
me to give PowerShell another look.

Another compelling reason to learn it is to that you can own Windows
computers more easily. If you like to hack in your spare time, and
Windows OSes have the most vulnerabilities of any operating system on
the planet, then it makes sense that you need to learn all the Windows
shit in order to own it. (Same for JavaScript and SQL, by the way).

So I'm adding PowerShell to my learning path at some point. I have a lot
more to learn in the cloud native space that matters a lot more than
PowerShell to me at the moment, but I'm good with learning the "Power"
of the PowerShell, which still makes me snicker because of how fucking
stupid that name is. Imma bash your 'power' shell into submission. Watch
me.

I suppose this is my coming-out to y'all. But PowerShell fan-boy might be a
stretch.
