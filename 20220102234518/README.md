# No More Fishies and Music Streams, For Now

As much as I love the fishies and music, and other people love to just
tune into them like a radio while coding and doing other things, it is
starting to get confusing for people who are regulars to the rwxrob.tv
stream. 

For example, people turn off notifications completely because they get
notified and I'm not here. That can be annoying even if I setup a better
system of live mode notification on Discord. I don't want to force
people to use Discord to get notifications, but if they want more
precise notifications setting them up on Discord is the easiest way for
most people. The priority is creating meaningful notifications.

The fishies and music will still be a part of rwxrob.tv, just when I
take a break that is under 30 minutes. In fact, I'm going to commit to
stopping the stream whenever I am away for more than 30 minutes, period.
I will still be streaming relatively boring stuff, like just a screen
full of coding with music in the background, but there won't be any more
"away" streams (even though I will still send the notification.

Eventually, I'll give the fishies their own channel and download all the
music from my favorite playlists and create a shoutcast radio station
out of it as well. Then I'll just setup a raspberry pi to stream it 24 x 7
on the appropriate Aquariums channel.
