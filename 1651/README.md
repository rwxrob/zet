# FAANG is Shit, Make a Difference, Like This

One of the controversial things about IBM is how much government work it
gets. But just look at the *billions* Elon Musk has personally spent
from "government subsidies" saving his shit-for-brains Tesla
corporation, and now SpaceX. (Go watch the documentaries on it if you
want to get more info on why Elon is a prick.)

Anyway, when I see things like Red Hat / IBM working with the
government to fix our education system, to modernize it, I am reminded
how many truly extraordinary career opportunities are going without
consideration from those seeking jobs today. They seem obsessed with
"FAANG" companies and big dollar signs. But I'm encouraged by the
significant number of them who just want a good job doing something
amazing for the world, corporate-driven or otherwise. And that is
*exactly* what this work Red Hat is doing. I can hate Red Hat as a
platform, despise OpenShift, but the fact remains, they are seeking work
in substantial areas of our society that is critically needed, not
feeding someone their next Netflix binge.

So hats off the few and the proud who quietly seek career opportunities
that *really* make a difference for society, that lift up, not distract
and tear down. I salute you. You need your own fucking holiday as far as
I'm concerned.
