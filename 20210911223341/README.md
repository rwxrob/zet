# Weekly Physical Training Schedule

This is my current schedule. I've adjusted it over the last few weeks as
my strength and stamina has improved. I'm hoping to get around 27m in
the Turkey Trot 5K coming up. I'm 54 an still want to put on muscle from
my running, not shred it off. But I still have body fat to lose.

Temp runs cover lower body (for me) so strength training is all upper
body.

|: Day :|: Description :|
|  Mon  | Run, Slow, Base Endurance, 1m/30s (~90m) |
|  Tue  | Strength, Upper Body 3m between sets (~60m) |
|  Wed  | Walk, Recovery (~90m) |
|  Thu  | Run, Fast, 5K Tempo Glides 2m/1m (~30m), Race Day |
|  Fri  | Strength, Upper Body 3m between sets (~60m) |
|  Sat  | Run, Slow, Base Endurance, 1m/30s (~90m) |
|  Sun  | Walk, Recovery, Someplace Fun (~90m) |

After the upcoming 5K I should have the base fitness to add 20-90
minutes of morning Ashtanga Yoga back to the list. I'll have to adapt it
to running recovery and remember to not overly stress hamstrings
especially.

After that I just need to sustain it until I'm 100 and not waver. When I
was at my peak I was doing Ashtanga daily, running every other day, and
at least 90 minutes of stand-up paddle-boarding twice a week. Not
shooting for that again, but I do hope to add adventure cycling back in
as well to supplement the running with leg strength training. The most
important muscles to build up before heading into 60+ years are the
gluts and legs. They provide stability and lower back support. After a
certain age you pretty much no longer have the ability to build new
muscle, so better pack it on right before you get there. Just ask Mick
Jagger.
