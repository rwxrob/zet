# Q: What do you think of the term "devops"?

1. Term really triggers people for different reasons
1. I personally prefer "infrastructure engineer"
1. Know one really knows what this means
1. Avoid the term (and the risk of being judged)
1. Speak in specifics about what you do
1. Describe what you do day to day
1. Use certified titles when possible
1. Open Credential Merit System might address
