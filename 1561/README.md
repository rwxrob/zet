# I Hate YouTube Comments and Know Why

I figured out why YouTube comments suck so badly. Everyone talks about
me in the third person. "He forgot this" and "save yourself time, he
thinks that." People disassociate from me completely, which is the
opposite of the entire fucking point. Twitch understands this. In fact,
the more a community engages with the streamer the better and people who
talk about the streamer instead of *to* the streamer are generally
corrected pretty quickly in my community when I respond. This distance
creates a feeling of false disconnection so people can say shit about me
as if they were not telling it to my face (which is the source of all
evil on the Internet). People wouldn't say most of what they do if they
had so say it while the person was listening to them in the chair next
to them. This has been a good lesson for me.
