# VSCode Workspace Actually Work, Just a Directory

Visual Studio Code has the idea of a workspace matching one-to-one with
a directory (folder) in the file system. All you have to do is use the
metaphorical names literally to see that is wrong. A "folder" is not a
"toolbox". It's just a fucking folder with stuff in it, none of which
contains a workspace on which to work, not even a "desktop" and
certainly no "toolbox". No, the term "workspace" needs to be reserved
(metaphorically) for something far better and more accurate, something
that contains the place to do your digital work, not the stuff you on
which you are working. That's the "work". The "workspace" is where you
do your "work". Once again, we see how fucking stupid the use of the
word is by the VSCode team.
