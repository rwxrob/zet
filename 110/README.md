# Git Commit Conventions

Can't find where I read it (long ago) but here are the conventions I
follow specifically for Git commit messages. You'll find these are
standard in any project that has a fucking clue (which does not include
most Node projects):

* Never longer than 50 characters
* Answer phrase "If I commit this patch it will ..."
* No end punctuation

I *never* include merge commit messages. I refuse to clutter my commit
log with shit that makes no fucking sense.
