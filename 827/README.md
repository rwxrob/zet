# Morons Creating PowerShell 'Cloud-Empowerment-Tools'

If you don't know why creating an *entire* 'toolset' bundling Git,
Kubectl, Terraform, Tekton, and the GCloud SDK (which were all developed
on and require Linux to run), that *requires* the user to use
PowerShell *only* to do the installation, with no Linux or bash in
the 'toolset' anywhere, then you are objectively a fucking moron (at
least in the IT Cloud sense) and should never work in IT again.

Stop pussy-footing around the requirement for your people to learn Linux
(and the Linux command line) and do the right thing: *train your people to
use Linux.* Otherwise, you end up with people giving Helm demonstrations
using `docker` on the command line, and using the GUI file explorer to
rename a file (because they don't know the fucking `mv` command).
Please, for the love of God, have some self-respect. Do the
right thing. Teach them Linux.

I'm so tired of enterprise CTOs making excuses for *not* educating
their tech people in the most significant operating system on planet
Earth --- especially given the number of very user-friendly Linux
distributions (like PopOS!) and the WSL2 support in Windows. Seriously,
get the courage to set goals for your enterprise and *get the fuck off
of Windows* for anything technical. Your company will be so much better
off. The companies that *are* doing this are destroying their
competition (and smiling with a knowing grin like an ugly dude with a
hot girlfriend who has a secret he really doesn't need to share).
Perhaps that's the only thing these CTOs will ever understand.

Honestly, consider this a PSA. *Train your people in Linux.* Microsoft
is. The end.
