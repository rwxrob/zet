# OpenShift Doesn't Even Use Go Templates

I don't have words for how fucking stupid the decision to not support Go
templates is in the OpenShift world. I will *never* willingly work with
OpenShift after learning about this (and a ton of other architectural
design fails):

First, why are they supporting so many templates? Pick one. This is just
going to make code bases completely unintelligible.

Second, there's no Go template here even though the `kubeadm`,
`kubectl` (and pretty much every other fucking utility related to
Kubernetes) has a `-o go-template` option *hard coded into it*. Why
would you be so stupid to not include them given this fact?
