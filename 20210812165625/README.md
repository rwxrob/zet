# EmojiBlocks, CommonMark Blockquotes with Meaning

We live in the age of emojis, which can communicate so much in just a
single symbol they have renewed linguists interest in cuneiform and
hieroglyphics. So why not add them to plain 'ol CommonMark blockquotes
to give them a style, mood, theme, and meaning. This is far more
sustainable than adding a new Markdown element (like some have done with
`:::`).

```markdown
> ðŸ˜„
> I'm really happy to have discovered this little trick for keeping my
> Markdown compatible with CommonMark while allowing some indication of
> mood or reason for a call out inline with everything else. Others have
> uses `:::` but obviously that is not needed.

> I'm really happy to have discovered this little trick for keeping my

This is so parsable as well, can search for any block of a specific type
just by looking for that first emoji on a blockquote line otherwise
hanging out on its own.
