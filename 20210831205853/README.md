# Book: Out of Their Minds (Sir Ken Robinson)

Perhaps the most influential (non-fiction) book of my life. This
wonderful man has no reverence for, well, anything even though he is
most decidedly and demonstrably a product of academia, for better or
worse. 

Ken didn't end up like all the other academics. Instead he seems
to have been *very* influenced by being exposed to them during most of
his life. 

Ken's a revolutionary in every positive sense of the word, and
has you laughing while crying at the current state of affairs where
children have their creativity "beaten out of them" in schools. 

Ken's not unlike a Robin Williams with a legitimate British accent, just
a bit more even-keel. Don't miss this read if education is near to your
heart, or you need further convincing that you don't need permission to
own your own learning and creativity.
