# RedHat's Undeniable 'Control Points' in Linux

I've had to accept a harsh reality lately. RedHat controls "enterprise"
Linux.

RedHat created `systemd`, controls `gdb` and `libvirt` and QEMU and KVM
(for which they bought the company that backs it in 2008) and Ansible.
And RedHat is pushing hard with OpenShift and Podman to control the
cloud native space as well. As much as you might hate where they are
taking things, their control over the enterprise market is nearly at
monopoly proportions --- especially considering their affiliation with
IBM and enterprise affinity for big companies with huge contracts that
they can call upon for support (and blame when things don't work). In
other words, RedHat (like it or not) *is* enterprise Linux. If you want
to work in Linux and/or cloud native in the enterprise, you cannot avoid
learning RedHat even if you use something else on your own.

It's also worth noting that RHEL comes with SELinux making it compliant
with many government and security industry standards. I don't believe
Ubuntu server does.
