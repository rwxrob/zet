# Some are Fast on Terminal, But Still Use GUI Web

I had to chuckle the other day watching one of the most efficient
people I have ever seen use a highly customized terminal with Vim and
Zsh and even some custom plugins to make it all so much more efficient.
But then he took like two minutes to search for something using Google
in a graphic web browser. At that point, I didn't chuckle, I laughed out
loud.

Why the fuck would you spend your entire free time optimizing your
terminal efficiency and *leave out* the most time consuming thing any
technologist does every day: *search the fucking web*!

It's bragging, but I could out search that guy with one hand on lynx
while drinking coffee with the other. So all my "old school" habits from
using `vi` for 20 years before he was born pay off in the end. Because I
actually learned to use `lynx` very effectively.

Moral of the story: if you are going to become a terminal master don't
leave *anything* out. Those who don't have requirements for graphic
email should also use `mutt`. Which reminds me I should go back to it.
But the amount of HTML email these days makes it virtually useless
because everything is being rendered with `w3m` anyway.
