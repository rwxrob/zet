# Considering Phd in Information Systems

I'm strongly considering applying to a Phd program focused on knowledge
management and communication science as initial started by Niklas
Luhman. Intuitively, most people know that the Zettelkasten method is
the most productive, efficient way to manage knowledge personally ---
and by extension to share with others in a consumable way. But being
able to conduct the research studies that refine these hypotheses
scientifically would be the ultimate offering to the world as we week to
*truly* understand human communication behavior. The benefits to society
could range from profitable business models to best note-taking methods.

I consider it an extension of my focus on natural languages.

It's also some place I could formalize the thinking and work related to
PEGN and KEG (obviously).

When I stop and consider it, my entire life has been filled with
obsession about how we communicate and how to make communication and
knowledge exchange easier and more productive. Ironically, I've not yet
produced any papers or books on the topic mostly because I have such a
huge hang-up over the very concept books with static content that is
fundamentally at odds with the fluid reality of *most* human knowledge.
