# Holiday Coffee in Bed Ends Horribly

I had a late night (mostly because of drinking Brandy and not being able
to sleep) so when my wife brought be coffee in bed I really appreciated
it. It's been a while. Then I fell back asleep and woke in screams as I
spilled the scalding hot fresh coffee all over my armpit while laying
down. 

When I jumped up in bed I smacked my head on the reading lamp.

Then, because I started Yoga again yesterday, my right shin locked in a
cramp and would not stop from the shock. 

There I was getting scalded and trying to get the cramp to stop at the
same time doing a contorted dance in my jammies. 

I was pretty loud. I want to believe I didn't scream like a 12 year old,
but I'm quite sure I did. It woke my step son who was trying to figure
out what was going on, even my wife couldn't figure it out. She just saw
me dancing around weird and making noises. My tee-shirt was black and no
one could even see it. They were frozen in a confused stupor wondering
how to help me and I couldn't communicate. 

"Here let me put some aloe vera on it."

My German wife is less than, um, delicate at most things that was no
different. I was not laughing, but I wasn't mean. I nearly puked from
the pain ('cuz I'm a wimp). So I curled up in a weird ball on my cozy
couch and just tried not to focus on the pain. No yoga today it seems.
Putting my arm down a slight bit causes all that burned flesh to touch
itself. 

I have to laugh now, at least I can, it wasn't funny when it happened,
like something out of Home Alone. I guess today the Universe 
thinks I'm a "filthy animal" for some reason. I suppose I am.
