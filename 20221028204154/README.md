# Sad that I have no time for afk.works

I really love what we started with the Association for Federated
Knowledge workers (afk.works) all those years ago. I did all the PEGN
and KEG/KN work under that project and was hoping to one day have
unofficial conferences of people who wanted to promote the Open
Credential Merit System (OCMS) and all that other great stuff to
renovate learning in our world.

But, alas, there is simply no time for such pro-active things in a world
that requires what it does of me to survive (and keep my wife on her
fast-tract to art greatness). Instead, I'll wait and hope for a time
when I can turn my hours down by about half once Doris is making the big
bucks and then return to what I love: helping establish a world-wide
network dedicated to improving tech education and empowering individuals
in doing so to make whatever difference in the world they choose.

I just deleted the GitHub afkworks organization (but keeping the
afk.works domain). I am migrating all the old docs and putting them into
my own:
