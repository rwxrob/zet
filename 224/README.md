# Go Templates in Beginner Boost, Bonzai Dynamic

Added dynamic command attributes to Bonzai, which are just first-class
functions in a DynMap, and now *anything* can be added to the help
documentation of any Bonzai Cmd. I did this because I needed it. I
wanted to calculate the location of cached and configuration data and
display it with the command. But I wasn't counting on the tremendous
secondary advantage of that allowing dynamic documentation content to be
used for education and to show how to create a Go template --- a
critical part of Go applications since the Go template syntax is used
*everywhere* in cloud native engineering. I'm really looking forward to
it.
