# Apparently Creating VMX File Only VMware Option

Very disappointed to discover that VMware does not allow the creation of
virtual machines from the command line. Apparently, they want to sell
you ESXi/Vsphere for that sort of thing. This leaves the only option to
create your own VMX file and hope that it doesn't break on an upgrade
someday.
