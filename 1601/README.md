# Dropping Almost All Web Training from Boost

As I've been pondering how to focus on stuff that matters for the Boost,
and stuff that is not covered by others, I realize that all but the most
minimal discussion of web development is simply a waste of my time.
There's an over-abundance of (mostly shitty) web training out on the
Net, but still, it is covered. Frankly, the world doesn't need more web
developers, it needs more software developers who happen to know how to
make applications for the web when needed. Based on that fact, I'll give
one week to HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the DOM, five hours total.
It will include all the resources to go look for if you want to go
deeper into those things, but that's it.
