# Can We Please Use Another Word Besides "Awesome"

I can't get the scene from Breaking Bad out of my head when Jesse's
girlfriend responds to him saying, "That's awesome!" with "Really. Does
it 'inspire awe'?" with the most dead-pan expression ever. That's how I
feel every time I read it. I really wish the "Awesome" lists out there
of resources using something else. Oh well. Add it to the list of things
that make be appear like a grumpy asshole. But at least I know Jesse's
kick-ass girlfriend would have agreed. God I love her character.
