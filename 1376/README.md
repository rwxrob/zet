# Just `/bin/bash` From Now On

I'm just tired of typing `/usr/bin/bash` and there is really no
difference from `/bin/bash`. (In multi-user systems once upon a time
there was, not anymore.) Besides, it's just as hard for non-bash people
to change and is the default shell on all major Linux user
distributions.

As for all the whiners complaining about POSIX compatibility? Guess
what, I was one of you. I'm so not any more. Bash is the most powerful
and empowering scripting and interactive shell on planet Earth and I can
(and have) objectively demonstrated that over and over.

If for some sad reason you still have to write POSIX only shell scripts
then there is always `shellcheck` to make sure you do it right after
having allowed all those amazing, wonderful "bash-isms" to soak into
your brain giving you shell super strength.

So `/bin/bash` here I come. If that annoys you, well, you can just
change it.
