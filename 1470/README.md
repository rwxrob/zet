# Change Terminal to 95 x 26 (Font Size 30)

I think the whole community has really suffering lately from the 80
columns per terminal now that I'm doing so much Kubernetes work that
always needs more than that. Plus, seeing more of the screen makes it so
much easier to see the context when coding. Hell, I might even be able
to actually use TMUX panes again (instead of just windows).

I just tested it on my medium screen-sized Google Pixel phone and I can
read everything without making it full screen, even with my bad old-man
eyes. I think we'll be fine.

(Of course, this is still Ubuntu Mono, my favorite standard font and
I have no intention of changing from my slightly modified Gruvbox theme.)
