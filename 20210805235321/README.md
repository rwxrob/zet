# Q: What size Zettelkasten notebook do you prefer?

I use a 8.5" x 5.5" sketchbook with a spiral binding that I can clip a
mechanical pencil to. I prefer to split it in half with a line and just
use them however. I like cognitive restraints so that I keep to a single
focused idea. I originally planned to move them all into digital form,
but find keeping them in the notebook fine until I want to do something
more permanent. Rather than throw them out, I will draw lines through
them to show they've been transferred or are no longer needed. I prefer
of paper most of the time, actually, since it doesn't chain me to a
screen and think better away from the screen (usually).

Be sure to read this before looking at anything else claiming to be
