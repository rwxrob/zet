# Learning `ed` is Way Better than Regex Golf

I'm realizing that learning `ed` --- particularly the `g/` command, the
parent of `grep` --- is a way more effective use of learning time than
playing around with regular expression golf. You can create a simple
buffer and edit it, then use different commands to see if you can
successfully modify the buffer and match *several* lines at a time. I
would never have seen that coming had I not played around with in for an
hour or two. The regular expressions learned are of the BRE and ERE
versions, same as `grep` so they immediately apply to everything else a
person learns about the command line (unlike PCRE, which are included in
pretty much every programming language, and are easy to pickup once a
person has learned ERE).
