# OMG Twitch Markdown is So Fucking Bad

Just spend a lot of time dutifully writing a description of my Twitch
live streaming modes only to discover that Twitch Markdown is virtually
non-existent. Here's a list so I can remember what *not* to do when
writing for Twitch:

* Every line return turns into a hard line break
* The back-tick (\`) inline code formatting is disabled
* Only inline link references are supported
