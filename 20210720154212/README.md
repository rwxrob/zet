# Just Say No to Vimium

It will fuck up your editor settings for a number of web sites and the
"exceptions" never works. If you have to use a graphic browser, just use
it as the GUI gods intended, and do everything else with a text-based
browser like `w3m` or `lynx` with *true* `vim` mappings enabled. You'll
be so much happier you did --- especially if you are planning any kind
of "interactive" or "live" certification exams that use a terminal
encapsulated within a web page.
