# CN VIPs: Kelsey Hightower, Google

Kelsey is all over the Internet talking about Kubernetes and at the time
of this writing was a Product Developer Advocate at Google. I continue
to see him cited and learn of him on podcasts. If something is tending

that he might not be as connected with emerging/incubated innovations in
the space that are mostly just discovered by watching what engineers and
developers are working on themselves.
