# Sure Sign of Installer Idiocy

If you use any installer, package or script or whatever, and if that
installer fucks with your `.bashrc` and `.profile` files --- sometimes
without even saying anything to you about it --- you can immediately
write off the whole fucking software package (or in the case of Rust,
language) for being complete dumb asses who don't even understand the
basic fundamentals of UNIX separation of concerns. It's one thing to
install files into standard locations, it is quite another to fuck with
someone's personal configuration files (which are often under source
management). You are completely without your rights to fucking scream at
such people who think this is actually a good idea.
