# DankChat is Amazing

DankChat TTS is worth it all by itself. It keeps track of all the chat
even when not on so you can make sure you don't miss anything. Just be
sure about the following gotchas:

* Names in Tools -> TTS -> Ignore list must be exact (caps, no spaces)
* Remember to add the regex for ! and # for things
