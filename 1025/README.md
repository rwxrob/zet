# KEG Master Node GitHub Conventional Name: `me`

I love `dot` for dotfile and such, but what to call a person's primary
KEG Master Node? Here are some possibilities:

* `keg` - will clash with my bonzai branch of the same name
* `kegsite` - keg specific, what if they have web stuff?
* `site` - could be a keg or web site
* `kegnode` - very keg specific, hard to know what it is by just looking
* `me` - isn't this just a little too cute?

That last one is growing on me. Nice and easy. Will never conflict with
anything else and if it did whatever named itself `me` is the dumb shit
that needs to die, not the owner of the GitHub account who *is* "me" in
that case.

"Or just find 'me' at 'rwxrob' on GitHub."

Yeah, that sounds nice.

I also like it because it can have your `cv` your personal notes, your
professional stuff, all of it. You just save everyone time who has to
"Google" you anyway before they hire you. Might as well be up front with
it all. If you really want you can make it private and invite people who
need to review it as reviewers. Waaaay better than Linked-fucking-in.
(God I HATE them.)
