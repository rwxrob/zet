# Things WSL2 Can Do That Local VM Cannot

* Sound and graphics
* Direct access to Windows filesystem
* Integrate with `xclip`/`gWSL`
* Create VMs from bash scripts
* Execute windows binaries from bash shell
* Use `find` for both Windows and WSL2 filesystem
* Work without installing additional VM software

And here are some ways around it:

* Run OpenSSH server on Windows
* SSH into the Windows system to do what you need
* Run RTMP server within OBS and play clips directly to it
