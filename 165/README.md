# ZettelMark: Tags Line

While tags were included in Luhmann's original zettelkasten, he did not
depend on them heavily for all the reasons that tags are cautioned on
YouTube, (mostly that the content itself should not need additional
hinting with tags if created well). Nevertheless, there is some
practicality and since Twitter and YouTube both support them it makes
sense to include.

* Must be absolutely the last line
* Must start with 4 or more spaces, then `#` (first tag)
* Must not exceed 72 total columns for line
* Only hashtags (no whitespace) separated by single space
* Avoid redundant tags when content itself would suffice

```markdown

```

Note that only 72 total columns (runes) are allowed for the tags line
and that it *must* be the very last line. This is a hard constraint of
ZettelMark (not EzMark) and zettels will be rejected without fixing
this. This constraint is specifically to force cognitive overhead when
creating tags so that only the shortest and best few are selected.
