# What is your opinion of NFTs?

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/dAXBJVGTsqs>

1. An NFT associates a digital asset with a token
1. How is it different than TF2 hats?
1. Tokens are *usually* through block chain ("coin")
1. NFTs are all about scarcity and uniqueness
1. I think scarcity is fine for collectors
1. It's a good idea to provide scarcity for digital
1. Think about the thing that have been created digital
1. Artificial scarcity is fine
1. I *don't* like promoting a "coin" as dependency for NFTs
1. My favorite (so far) is "unique" Git commits
1. People are sensitive about establishing value
1. NFTs have really brought focus on crypto-currency
