# Key Command Line Utilities for Streaming Community

A set of key utilities has emerged that I use daily to keep this all
running, the Zettelkasten, with Twitch, and GitHub, and YouTube, and
Twitter. 

Here are the main ones (but they all need more work):

***`zet`*** - Zettelkasten
***`yt`*** - YouTube
***`twitter`*** - Twitter
***`clip`*** - Video Clips
***`t`, `topic`, `topics`*** - Update Topic
***`iam`*** - Streamer Mode
***`gh`*** - GitHub (Aliases)
***`auth`*** - Oauth (integrate `pass`)
***`config`*** - Local Configuration
***`pomo`*** - Pomodoro Timer
***`fishies`*** - Interactive Fish Animation

Planned:

***`matrix`*** - Matrix
***`discord`*** - Discord
***`slack`*** - Slack
***`bits`*** - Give Community Members Points
***`mim`*** - Daemon Acting on My Behalf
***`marquee`*** - Manage and Animated Status Line

Unrelated, but important:

***`pegn`*** - Parsing Everything
***`keg`*** - Knowledge Exchange Grid
***`kn`*** - KEG Node Utility

Once upon a time I had a command called `live` that did a lot of this
stuff.

I should probably create a `tv` command to rule them all and
specifically put the following into it:

`t`, `topic`, `topics`, `iam`, `away`, `quiet`, `talking`, `ranting`, `live`, `recording`
