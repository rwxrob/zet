# Use 72 Max Cols/Width in Vim/Whatever

I'm so fucking tired of reading people's shitty comments that wrap
prematurely because they set their cols/width to 80 instead of 72, the
long established best practice for wrapping *anything* with enough
gutter to work on an 80 column screen and the IETF RFC style
requirement.

I mean, I'm okay with you going off and saying everyone has to have a
100 width terminal if that is your thing. What really irks me is when
someone *attempts* to support the standard 80-col terminal width in
their code and them fails to set it to 72. This blows up the OCD in me
because everything is *just barely* off by a few characters. My TMUX is
set to 81 columns and I *still* can't fit your shit on my screen. I'd
have to set it to 84 to make up for these dumb-asses.
