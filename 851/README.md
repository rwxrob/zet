# Reason #28 to Only Learn Bash and Vim

Okay, maybe not that specific number, but something like that. Here it
is very simply: you can't use anything but vim and bash on the official
Kubernetes or OSCP certification exams. So if you chosen path has
anything to do with the hottest and highest paying technical fields in
the world right now (cloud and secops) you can't even *do* the fucking
exams without knowing raw Vi/m. (Okay, fine, you can use `nano` but why
the fuck would you ever do that?)

Every bit of learning and muscle memory you burn into your brain for
anything but Vim is wasted and going to directly cause you to get a
worse certification score because these things are timed. You might not
be the type of person to get into certification, but if you are, not
only should you learn Vim, but you should completely master it in
vanilla form and keep it that way. For the CNCF certs you can actually
setup aliases in `.bashrc` and `.vimrc` a bit. It also means that you
should learn to script in `bash` because you can create quick scripts to
do thing better over time. The more this stuff just flows out of you
because you do it all day, every day, the better. That's just the
objective reality. If you want to get good, master the defaults before
blowing brain cells and dumb-shit extensions.
