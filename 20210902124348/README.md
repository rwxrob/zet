# Boost: Next and Previous

* Navigate Boost content confidently
* Explain why there can be several next or previous nodes
* Draw a map of your learning path

The Boost content has unique, non-linear content that would make putting
it into a book nearly impossible. That's because *learning itself* is
usually non-linear (despite all that has been forced upon us). It only
makes sense, then, to provide a way to navigate from any given
***learning node*** to any possible ***next node*** on that path, or to
any possible ***previous node*** that leads to it. It's like a learning
MUD, a MUD for learning, or MUDL (yeah, I just invented that acronym).
