# Boost: Doors, Next and Previous

* Navigate Boost content confidently
* Explain why there can be several paths
* Draw a map of your learning path

The Boost content has unique, non-linear content that would make putting
it into a book nearly impossible. That's because *learning itself* is
usually non-linear (despite all that has been forced upon us). It only
makes sense, then, to provide a way to navigate from any given
***learning node*** to any possible ***next node*** on that path, or to
any possible ***previous node*** that leads to it. It's like a learning
MUD, a MUD for learning, or MUDL (yeah, I just invented that acronym).

Each ***zettel*** for a ***learning node*** (or ***room***) has a
section for 'Doors:' with links to other rooms. Even though you might
have arrived in the room through one door you can then see that there
are other doors you might not know about some that have lead there from
different paths, others that take you further down another path. The
path you take is up to you.
