# Don't Hate Documentation, Volunteer

If you are the new person on the team and have a lot to learn you might
actually be the perfect person to write the documentation that the other
engineers and developers don't want to write. Why? Because you are the
noob who is going to ask questions that other users are likely to ask.
Plus, it helps you immediately make friends.

All this applies for *both* enterprise career work as well as opensource
projects.
