# Get A Linux Terminal

The Linux terminal is the most powerful, ubiquitous tool any
technologist can add to their personal and professional kit. It unlocks
powers and opportunities unimaginable to those bound to graphic user
interfaces. These days getting access to a Linux terminal isn't nearly
as hard as it once was. Choose your own adventure here:

* Install Windows WSL2
* Install a Linux Virtual Machine on Windows or Mac
* Install a Linux Operating Systems on a Computer
* Get Started with Linux on Raspberry Pi
* Install Docker Desktop on Windows or Mac and a Linux Image
* Create a Linux Server on a Hosting Service

Any of these methods will work for the boost. Remember, however, that
the goal is to get a **Linux** terminal. (Macs are BSD Unix)
