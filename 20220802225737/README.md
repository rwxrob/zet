# Q&A 

* What are we doing and when?

* Hey rob, question for you: I'm a JS/react dev, and i'd really like to
  make a shift into more functional/backend/tooling type of stuff. Do i
  just tell my employer and hope they let me start to shift over, or do
  you think its possible to just start looking for a new job with zero
  actual experience in that realm (I have very little free time for
  projects lately, but I do intend on making some fun things)?

* Should I ask/trust my employer to let me do what I want in the future?

* How do I make time to prepare for what I want to do in the future?

* How much experience do I need before I apply for a new job?

* What should I learn form "backend tool type of stuff"?

* How to improve courage as an IT employee?
