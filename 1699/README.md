# Oh my god! keg/zet/kn is working for local content creation

Been really pushing this hard for a while and I finally have something to show for it, a complete rewrite of `zet` as `keg` (or `kn` which is easier to type) that is so sticking fast I just can't even deal, and I still am indexing after every single edit and change, so it will get even faster.

Perhaps the biggest yak shaving win was realizing all the different output formats that are possible for the `keg.Dex` once I turned it into a slice. I can render it to db-loadable TSV files, or JSON, or markdown with the time stamps, or without for inclusion into other kegs as an include list.

It's that feeling like you just got a *huge* new toy and can't wait to try it out when the snow melts. It's already shot my productivity up for finding stuff and creating content when the ideas happen. Now it is just a matter of letting it simmer and adding the stuff into the stew to make it really savory. Next will be an actual KEGMLX expansion so that I can produce full, single-page Web sites, PDFs, ePubs, and --- yes, finally --- books getting published on Amazon and Gumroad.
