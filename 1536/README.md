# Reconsidering Content for Boost Programming

I've always kept it fun in the Boost and done memes and stuff to keep
people's attention (and we can still do that) but I'm feeling motivated
to sneak in data structures and algorithms without them even realizing
that is what they are doing. Then at some point we do a reveal and
associate all the computer science-y jargon that goes with them. There's
no doubt a lot of them are useful for things well outside of coding.
Handling a node tree, for example, comes up all the time in other fields
including statistics, linguistics, biology, well, pretty much
everything. The trick now is to rethink the activities I've done in the
past and see how we could incorporate data structures.
