# Streaming is Hard

These days I am typing pretty intensely at the keyboard for about eight
hours (on average). I do take breaks, of course, but the strain on my
body is very real. It's not unlike an e-sport. This is why software
developers burn out so much, and, I imagine, why so many Twitch
streamers just give the whole thing up.

* Simplify the schedule (fewer missed expectations)
* Add Discord stage to more (maybe even all) streams
* Remember, you don't really owe anyone anything (except your employer)
