# Kubernetes Learning Blacklist

I've uncovered some of the *worst* information about Kubernetes and just
had to make a note of these so that I (and others) can avoid them them
like the plague. Beginners will be nothing but confused and dangerous
after reading anything here:

*<https://www.educba.com/kubernetes-service-types/>* Services are
misspelled and just described completely incorrectly. "LoadBalancer"
does *not* require a cloud provider, for example (that is MetalLB is
for).
