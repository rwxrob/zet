# Dungeons and Dragons FTW!

So many brilliant people I have met over the years were avid Dungeons
and Dragons players as kids. Colbert is my favorite example. I believe
the act of imagination and role-play is what molded the brains of these
effective learners as they were placed in challenge after challenge ---
with life or death consequences --- and asked to figure it out --- for
fun. D&D produced some of the world's best critical thinkers as a result
even if it might of just been a side-effect of having fun in this way.
