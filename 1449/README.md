# Restarting Windows Pauses VirtualBox VMs

Very pleased to learn after trying to startup a new TMUX session and
being told that there was already one running, that VirtualBox blocks
the Windows shutdown process until all running VMs are paused saving
their state. This is fucking amazing --- especially when compared to the
rather clunky fail of WSL2 to not do the same thing even though it is
a part of Windows itself.
