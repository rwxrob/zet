# Q: What is a Beginner Boost?

The Beginner Boostâ„¢ is my name for the content and community designed to
get you moving down the path to mastering the core tech and other skills
that are required for any *good* tech job. The Boost is, therefore, my
highly opinionated answer to the frequently asked rwxrob.tv question,
"What and how should I learn to get (and keep) a job in the tech
industry?" Spoiler alert: it's not "web dev."

My boosts are definitely flavored for hacking and infrastructure
operations (including "cloud-native"). These are skills that underlie
everything else. They are rock-solid and sustainable. In fact, there is
a serious drought in the industry now for *good* infrastructure
operations engineers, mostly because these skills are not normally
taught in school, not even in tech universities like MIT, and certainly
not in any "bootcamp." The Boosts are focused entirely on tools and
technologies *that actually matter* to those hiring for *real* jobs (not
opinionated, uninformed, "like and subscribe", loud-mouth, Linux
hobbyists on YouTube and Twitch).

For example, when we do study the web we cover the languages and
protocols, not so much to make slow GUI web apps, but to understand how
they work and, yes, how to hack them when web people inevitably fail. We
learn `lynx` and `curl` to manipulate pages and protocols from the
command line. When we do "browse" the Web, we focus on getting answers
fast, real fast. We are safe from insecure JavaScript, privacy
violations, and slow graphics because we've learned the bash Linux shell
first allowing us to *dominate* the skills learned by others.

This is the way.
