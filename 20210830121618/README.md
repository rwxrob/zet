# What is a Beginner Boost?

Let's consider another question:

"What should I learn to get a job in tech?"

The Beginner Boostâ„¢ is my highly opinionated response to this question,
which might lead you to another one:

"Who the hell are you?"

Hello, friend. I'm Rob. I stream on rwxrob.tv, founded skilstak.io, and
work full-time as a Systems Infrastructure Engineer and Software
Developer on a Cloud-Native team supporting Kubernetes for a
High-Performance Computing (HPC) Machine Learning group within one of
the largest corporations in the world (with its own Class A subdomain).
Don't worry that will all make sense soon enough.

I've made it my life's work to professionally mentor *everyone and
anyone* to help them take control of their learning and lives,
empower themselves with *real* tech skills, share their learning with
others, and change the world. That's why I founded SKILSTAK with my own
retirement money and later started live-streaming and creating this
Boost content. I'm here to build a community of like-minded people to
help each other level-up to wherever they want to be.

Hopefully, you are here because you heard about me from someone you
trust. That's one thing mentorship and employment both require. Sure
I've helped a lot of people, but they honestly have helped me just as
much. I literally got my current job from a member I met through this
community. Won't you join us?

"Sure, but what will I learn?"

My boosts are definitely flavored for hacking and infrastructure
operations (including "cloud-native"). These are skills that underlie
everything else. They are rock-solid and sustainable. Most jobs required
them, and all jobs will benefit from them. Starting salaries are
*always* over \$100K in this field. In fact, there is a serious drought
in the industry now for *good* infrastructure operations engineers,
mostly because these skills are not normally taught in school, not even
in tech universities like MIT, and certainly not in any "bootcamp." 

The Beginner Boostâ„¢ is focused entirely on tools and technologies *that
actually matter* to those hiring for *real* jobs. While others might
argue about the "best" Linux distro or programming language we focus on
stuff that companies are hiring (and paying six-figure salaries) for
*today*. Here is just one example:

> Clearly, you have a talent for educating people in tech. â€¦ After
> [your memberâ€™s] success [here], I suspect the review team will be
> even more interested in picking up one or two of your students.
> We've had a lot of very bright interns from some of the top
> universities in the country and [your community member] was right
> in the mix with the best of them.

This "junior" technologist, with a psychology degree and few prospects,
went on to land a \$100,000 job at one of the most exciting companies in
the cloud-native space after completing the learning in the Boost that he
taught *himself*. I was just along for the ride.

"What does 'flavored for hacking and operations' mean?"

Here's an example. When we study the Web we cover the languages and
protocols, not so much to make slow "serverless" GUI web apps, but to
understand how they work and, yes, how to hack them when Web people
inevitably fail. 

We learn everything from the Linux bash terminal including `lynx`,
`curl`, and `netcat` to manipulate pages and protocols from the command
line. When we do "browse" the Web, we focus on getting answers fast,
real fast. We are safe from insecure JavaScript, privacy violations, and
slow graphics because we've learned the bash Linux shell first allowing
us to *dominate* the skills learned by others. It's not that we *think*
we're better than others. We objectively are. You will become part of
the 0.01% of technologists who actually know this stuff. The trick is to
keep your ego from taking you over. (Alas, I've lost a few to 'Anakhin
Syndrome' in the past).

Let's get you started with your first mission (which is what I'm calling
each step along the path these days):
