# Avoid `g:go_auto_type_info`, Forces "Press ENTER"

I had to disable the `vim-go` setting to automatically print the type in
the status bar. I prefer only giving up one line for status and such and
that was the only fix. Besides, I practically never looked at it. It is
still faster all-around to just to a terminal `lynx` search and get not
only the syntax but the relevant docs about it.
