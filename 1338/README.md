# Story: The Snarky Kid Who Googled the Answer and Won

Once upon a time I was in a live SkilStak session with about ten people
crammed into our little space. They were mostly new.

I asked a not so simple question that could be looked up rather easily
online. Everyone was sitting in front of their computers and had their
own 40" television monitor hooked up to it as well. (Easier for me to
keep an eye on them.)

One snarky, rebellious kid with a grin on his face (I tend to attract a
lot of them into my mentored community) searched for the answer right in
front of us on the screen as if to assert himself as being the dominant
smart-ass in the group (of mostly smart-asses).

Of course, a hyper-intelligent suck-up Nellie Oleson (also the type I
tend to attract) loudly told on him.

"Mr. Rob, Mr. Rob, he just Googled it. He didn't really know it."

I paused, smiled with my own smart-ass grin, and responded.

"Yep, and he did it faster than you. Now he knows it and you don't."

The suck-up wilted and eventually stopped coming altogether. People who
play by the system of oppression really hate it when people who
*actually* know what's up expose them. My "evil" rebellious new member
had done just that, and won.

Unfortunately, we have to help these smart-ass "evil" people to realize
that their actions aren't evil at all. In fact, they should encouraged
to look stuff up, to "cheat" honestly, and take the shortcuts that lead
to success without the cost of their soul and ethics. Otherwise, they
will think they themselves are evil and start doing *truly* evil stuff
if not caught in time that will drag them down to Hell, one way or
another.
