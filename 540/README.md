# Use `ffmpeg` to Stream Directly to OBS from GoPro

Just noticed that I can just wear the GoPro with my lav mic and stream
directly to OBS from home. This means I just have to create an
additional scene and wear the camera and mic. This is a huge
breakthrough for me because it means I can stream from my
garage/warehouse/server-room eventually without having to carry around
my phone with me. Or, at least, just have my phone with me to control
the scenes and stuff. As long as I have wifi this is the best/easiest
option.

I still have the lav mic remote transmitter when I just need to have
audio available remotely, which I can use to interview people as well
when I just use the regular mic. But I have a feeling I could set up an
OBS scene as well that just uses the audio from the ffmpeg stream and
layer that on top of the fishies or whatever.
