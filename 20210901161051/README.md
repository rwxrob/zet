# Sticking with Docker Desktop for Beginner Boost

Despite the announcement today that Docker Desktop is no longer free for
'Enterprise Use' I'll be keeping it at the center of my Beginner Boost
approach even though the new CYOA Boost content approach leaves many
more options for people to choose their own path. Some might go with
Vagrant/Virtual Box, others with a remote login system, still other
ambitious Boosties will install Linux onto their own hardware.

I cannot control what these people will be able to use at their eventual
places of employment. Some companies will be clueless, others cutting
edge. In fact, having multiple paths to a Linux terminal is a good skill
to learn because you never know what you are gonna get.
