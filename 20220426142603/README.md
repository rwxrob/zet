# Scoping Knowledge

When creating and consume knowledge there seems to be a few organic
scopes and sizes:

1. Title - 50 characters or less (git commits, titles, etc.)
1. Micro - 380 characters or less (one tweet, or long paragraph)
1. Zettel - about 25 lines of 72 columns (one Luhmann "zettel")
1. Digest - readable in one bathroom sitting (reader's digest, etc.)
1. Article - longer than digest (newspaper, blog, magazine, etc.)
1. Section - about size of article but part of chapter
1. Chapter - multiple sections
1. Part - multiple chapters
1. Book - multiple parts

This is a zettel. It fits on about one of my terminal screens. The
Twitch commands I use are micros.

I think this difference in scoping is why there will need to be a `kn`
tool in addition to a `zet` tool. The `kn` tool will encompass the
Zettelkasten but include other, more polished and varied knowledge
scopes. For example, one *knowledge node* type will be a micro
collection in a single YAML file, which is very different than the
conventions for maintaining stuff in my zet. There will definitely be
some crossover, which is why I'm writing this. I don't want to maintain
stuff in two places if I can help it.
