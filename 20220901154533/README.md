# Containerd VS CRI-O

This is a place to summarize difference between the two biggest
container engine competitors (k8s 1.24 requires one or the other):

* containerd is a full drop-in run-time replacement for `docker`, crio
  is not

* crio has big backing and support from IBM, REDHAT, Intel, SUSE and
  lots of other enterprise-y things, containerd is driven by Docker and
  a broader, more FOSS-y community

* crio was specifically designed and optimized for k8s, containerd for
  docker, it's important to note that Docker (as a company) has been
  through many financial troubles and business problems and frankly
  should not be considered stable, at all, the founder left "to pursue
  other interests"

* containerd is simpler with usability as a priority; crio is more
  complex, maybe faster, but less focused on usability

* containerd does not have specific versions compatible with specific
  k8s versions; crio was so buggy it was unusable before 2022 but seems
  better now even though different versions of crio are still required
  for different k8s version, but k8s 1.24 (which banishes docker
  entirely) is a huge milestone and will be the baseline for a long
  times

* both end up running containers using runc (libcontainer written in Go)
