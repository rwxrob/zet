# Removing the Q: from Questions in Zettelkasten

I thought it would be cute. And like Ryan Dahl has said, "it's those
cute things you added that always come back to bite you in the ass".
Adding the Q just takes up space. Hell, I could search for titles
containing an *actual* question mark if I want to find all the
questions. I added it because that is how I identify questions in the
chat logs (and that won't be changing).
