# Just Turn Work Off, Literally

I've made a lot of progress in time management and life balance lately
and it is really paying off, my coding sessions are more productive and
efficient, my breaks are more fulfilling and guiltless, and I'm getting
physically healthy again. But one of the things that has really helped
in every way is just turning work off, literally, sleeping or shutting
down my work computer and letting it *stay that way*. It might sound
easy to do, but it is ridiculously hard if you have been slightly
distracted all day on other things making it constantly feel like you
still have more work to do, but you have no idea how much work. The
other stuff all combines to allow me to do the best thing of all for my
health: turn the fucking thing off. It feels amazing. I highly recommend
it.
