# Pleased with Minimal Zettel Model

After more than eight years tweaking different forms of knowledge
organization I've never been more pleased than with the resulting Zettel
Model that has materialized this week.

The biggest break-through relates to the simplicity and size of a
zettel. Discovering the Zettelkasten method really gave me permission to
force the most granular possible knowledge organization without fear of
missing out on everything that comes from larger compositions.

Zettelkasten says, "it's not finished, but will be, stop worrying" and
that is the permission I needed to make the constraints I have. "It's
all just a bunch of notes, dumb ass," is how I imagine Luhmann would
speak to me (if he had my personality). 

This simplicity means, for example, that there is only one heading to
deal with, and it happens to also be the title. That *every* zettel
requires a title even if you think it is just a "log entry". It means
there is only one line of tags, the last line, and that there is only
one possible image (a figure) per zettel. 

"DEAL WITH IT!" (That's me telling my saner self to stop fretting and
keep-it-simple-stupid.)

Having all the links and written references in a single bullet list
allows the author and reader to switch into "where can I read more about
this" cognitive mode rather than jarring them mentally between that mode
and "ooo, this is interesting" flow state while reading it.
