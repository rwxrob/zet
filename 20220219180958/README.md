# VirtualBox is Best with Hyper-V On

While disabling the WSL2 feature in Windows I noticed that Hyper-V is
still on. I did some research and it turns out using VirtualBox *with*
Hyper-V enabled is still better than disabling it and forcing
"paravirtualization" instead.

* Use VirtualBox 6.0 and Hyper-V at the same time thanks to the Hyper-V API - Virtualization - Tutorials - InformatiWeb
