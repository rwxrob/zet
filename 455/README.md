# Learn Python and Go the Hard Way

Just realized while helping cbear495 (from our community) find a good
book about Python programming, and remembering how good Python the Hard
Way was (all those years ago when a parent told me about it in 2014),
that I could actually help people learn to program in Go at the same
time and just use that to show the similarities with a polyglot
programming approach.

Looking forward to trying that in early 2022 after we complete the C
Boost (Head First C).
