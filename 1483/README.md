# Practical Learning About Virtualization

Here's what I suggest to get your head around all that is possible with
virtualization. Eventually, I'll have learning labs of these after
having gone through it. Others can do it in their own way.

1. Install VirtualBox
1. Setup a Windows into a VM in VirtualBox
1. Setup an Ubuntu Linux VM in VirtualBox 
1. Setup an Arch Linux VM in VirtualBox 
1. Setup a RedHat Linux VM in VirtualBox 
1. Setup a SUSE Linux VM in VirtualBox 
1. Install Vagrant as Docker container (fewer bugs)
1. Setup a VirtualBox VM using `vagrant` (container)
1. Install KVM/QEMU/`libvirt`/`virsh`/`libvirtd` and Configure
1. Setup a libvirt VM Using `virt-manager`
1. Setup libvirt VM using `vagrant` (container)
1. Setup multiple VMs at the same time using `vagrant`
1. Configure multiple VMs with `ansible` combined with `vagrant`
1. Setup several physical servers at home
1. Combine physical servers with Proxmox or (something)
1. Install Terraform client
1. Setup several VMs using Terraform pointed at Proxmox
