# How would you change how you learned Kubernetes?

* My opinions are *specifically* for a "infrastructure engineer" role
* Learn Linux, containers, and networking *well*
* Master Docker, Dockerfile, and Docker bridge networks
  * *Not* waste time on Docker compose
* Watch Nana's "Zero to Hero in Kubernetes"
* Would focus entirely on learning with Kind
  * How to add an Ingress (NGINX)
  * How to add a LoadBalancer (MetalLB)
* Would *immediately* start work on a local physical cluster
  * Specifically since I support an *on-prem* cluster
  * The older and weirder the hardware, the better
  * On-prem helps you get good with *everything* not just k8s
* Actually, shunning virtual machines (personally)
