# Be `dap`er About Vim

Just realized I have not been using `dap` nearly as much as I should be.
It deletes the current paragraph no matter where I am. In fact, I
realize I have never really learned all of the vim master combos because
I'm still very much a vi guy, which is fine. But might as well adopt
more of the Vimisms now that the entire world of terminal stuff is
pretty much containerized and allows the use of local editing sessions
with bind-mounted volumes. 

I have been using `yaf` and `yif` though (in Go at least). I think all
of this needs to go into a *good* Vim tutorial (instead of the shit in
`vimtutor` which leaves out things like `C`.
