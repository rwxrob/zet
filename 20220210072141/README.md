# Boost Will Focus on VirtualBox Ubuntu Server

After a lot of reflection and experimentation I strongly feel that the
best focus for the Boost is on *all* major operating systems, that the
primary purpose of the Boost should, in fact, be exactly that. Linux is
first and foremost a server operating system and that's how we should
first learn about it. If people want to learn about Kali as well that's
fine, just later on their own time. Learning Ubuntu Server will make
them all the more prepared if they do decide to learn Kali later.

While I plan on mentioning VMware Workstation Pro, I've decided to use
VirtualBox for the boost because it works enough and is free. It also
has a much more powerful command line and has good support from
`libvirt` (which I eventually want use for `fluff`). For Mac M1 users
I'll just tell them that VMware Fusion does what VirtualBox does not
(nor has any plans of ever doing).
