# So GitHub really failed on the CSV/TSV thing

Simple delimited files have always avoided the cluster-fuck that MS forced on everyone. Now GitHub is owned by Microsoft and it is no surprise their display of TSV is *totally fucked*. I swear, who even peer reviews any of their shit before it gets launched into production.

***HEY GITHUB, YOU CANNOT CALL IT TSV IF YOU REQUIRE QUOTE ESCAPING!***

I'm getting an error that says my TSV data is using "illegal quoting" for a title that simply has double quotes in it. That's the entire fucking point of *tab*-separated values instead of fucking CSV (which has always been a horrible fail from Microsoft). CSV has *never* been about just separating with commas and making sure stuff doesn't have commas, oh yeah, and that you use double quotes, sometimes.
