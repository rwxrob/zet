# Adding Closed Captioning to Twitch

*80% of all Facebook use is without sound.*

It's actually rather easy to add CC support to Twitch with OBS. I've
created a bash script to install it automatically based on the detected
version of OBS (which is critical).

Disabling CC is unnecessary with my setup because I turn all sound into
my computer down from a sound board, which is easiest. This includes
sound sent to Discord or anything.
