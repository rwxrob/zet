# Why don't you like OOP/Java/C++/C#/SmallTalk?

It's not that I don't like *true* OOP. I've just seen *class-based* OOP
abused so much that I agree with Brian Cantrill about the "dark times"
of the 90s when it emerged. Here's another explanation:

First let me say that there are many principles that are associated with
OOP that are *not* in fact just OOP:

* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Separation of Concerns
* Interfaces

These things are well-established best practices and present in *many*
other languages with different paradigms.

But the *class-based* OOP primarily associated with Java and C++ and
SmallTalk (originally) has been overwhelmingly proven to be a broken
paradigm --- especially single inheritance models.

What really pisses me off is how totally entrenched it has become in
everything down to our AP computer science tests. The entire industry
has been plagued by the largest marketing efforts ever done for a
programming language (\$500k for Java) and we are still seeing its
massively negative affect all through the industry even today.

For those who *truly* want to understand this issue (and frankly most
who ask me the question don't) then watch the following videos
completely before you *ever* breathe a word of question about this to me.
Otherwise, you are just wasting all of our fucking time.

My favorite is this [video from Jim Coplien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrBQmIDdls4):

Jim: "Who here is has ever done any object-oriented programming?"

Crowd sheepishly raises hands.

Jim: "Okay, you there, what language to you program in?"

Scared Coder: "Java"

Jim spitting and pointing: "Java is the *only* language in which you
*cannot* write object-oriented programming code!"

Why all that?

Because no one even knows *what the fuck* true object-oriented
programming even is. I didn't. I drank the Koolaide in the 90s big
time. I even gave presentations at conference about Java. I coded
thousands of lines of Java, and was burned by all the negative things
that are not widely regarded as the problem. At one such conference one
of the creators of Java was asked a telling question:

"If you could change one thing about the language what would it be?"

"Inheritance, " he replied.

The crowd roared with laughter because they thought he was kidding.

He wasn't.

People throw the words related to OOP around like crazy because the
gang of three dumb asses convinced the world that things like Java and
C++ are *actually* object-oriented, but they *never* were. You cannot
even code OOP in Java. In C++ you can, but you have to break from the ++
part and more of the C part.

There are two other great video references to these problems. My
favorite is from [Brian Cantrill](https://youtu.be/HgtRAbE1nBM) but
[Brian Will's video](https://youtu.be/QM1iUe6IofM) is also *very* good,
just less comedic.

So no jungle with your banana.
