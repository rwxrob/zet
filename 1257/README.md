# Gnome-Terminal Settings

Here are my regular configurations for my gnome-terminal for streaming
at maximum contrast and clarity (without being annoying). Keep in mind
I run a 1080p (60hz) display resolution at 16:9 (even though I have a 4K
monitor) since it takes the load off of OBS. That's 79 columns and 22
lines, which is pretty close to the original base terminal sizes. These
settings are specifically to optimize readability on the smallest
screens and from the back of a classroom when displaying at the front of
the class (a digital chalkboard essentially).
