# The (Actual) UNIX Philosophy

Doug invented UNIX pipes, so yeah.

People get this wrong all the time. The stop with the first part "do one
thing well" and conveniently forget the rest.

Personally, my favorite list of clarifications is from Mike Gancarz (who
helped create X):

1. Small is beautiful.
2. Make each program do one thing well.
3. Build a prototype as soon as possible.
4. Choose portability over efficiency.
5. Store data in flat text files.
6. Use software leverage to your advantage.
7. Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability.
8. Avoid captive user interfaces.
9. Make every program a filter.

This is why I find myself preferring to script in bash than to do
anything else unless absolutely necessary. Developer productivity is far
more important than the rest.
