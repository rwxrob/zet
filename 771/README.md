# Zettelkasten Static Site Generator for Web

Been thinking about <https://boost.rwxrob.tv> and what to point it at
and realizing it is about time to get some HTML content out of the
zettelkasten that I maintain so that I can make it more readable and
available on the web. I was hoping to wait a bit before having to do
this but it needs to be done. For now just a `zetgen` binary is all that
is needed so that I can enable the use of Go templates (instead of
Pandoc templates). It's not a complicated program. In fact, it could use
only the configuration from the zettelkasten stuff. It only has to be a
single binary if I do it that way. It'd rather write this than do the
whole thing with pandoc only to redo it later.
