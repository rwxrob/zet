# Drop Computer Internals from Boost, Keeping in C

One thing that has come from all this Head-First C streaming is that C
*really* pulls you close to the hardware. This is absolutely critical
to get a true understanding of computers and computing. Everyone should
do it, yes even web developers. It also is more natural than trying to
explain how computers work in the Beginner Boost when people are just
focused on becoming productive IT professionals. Therefore, I'm removing
any non-trivial mention of computer architecture from the Boost and
leaving it in the annual Head-First C stream.
