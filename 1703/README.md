# Gifted five subs, completely ignored, not even minor thank you

Just gifted five subs to a Twitch streamer in the spirit of the holidays after thinking their Twitter post "Ha ha ha ha. Ok loser" regarding my announcement that I'm leaving Twitter over the shit Elon is doing was sort of a joke. I guess not.

Not only did they completely scroll past them on stream, they decided to not even mention it, then later say, "no, I did see them" reinforcing that they saw them and deliberately chose to be a major dick and not to even say, "Thanks for the subs" (which, by the way, is the polite human thing to do).

I wasn't fishing for compliments, or flexing, or searching for some validation. It was a very sincere, holiday-driven gesture. And the response was, um, less than human. Fuck 'em.

What have I learned?

1. First, I've learned that no matter how much I try, I can't *not* give a shit.
1. I try to be all things to everyone.
1. I have *very* strong opinions, but somehow I also still want people to like me even when I'm calling out dumb shit that they are doing and thinking (and would ask they do the same with me).

On the up side, this helps me realize who I *actually* care about, not this person. There is a very peculiar type of person with whom I can be really amazing friends, problem is they are are *very* rare and are usually from "gen x". Happily, I married one, and I suppose that is all that matters in the end. My wife fully understands this dilemma and talks about it herself a lot as well. To those few amazing people you can *truly* call friends, hold them dear. The rest can fuck right off and die.
