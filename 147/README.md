# Refresh Gnome Desktop without Reboot

There are many ways to fix a Gnome desktop that stops behaving properly,
but perhaps the simplest and least dangerous is simply opening up the
Run dialog (`fn` + `alt`/`option` + `f2`) from Gnome and entering the
one-letter command `r`. Such a simple thing to save you so much hassle
when for some reason your fonts stop displaying properly (or at all).
