# Don't Pretend You Know Just to Save Face

I'm so fucking tired of working with people in the enterprise who just
cannot accept that they don't understand what you are talking about and
try to create flowery language to get around the simple fact that they
either don't know about what you are talking about or are otherwise
hesitant to say, "No, I don't know." Even worse when it becomes a
pissing match in a meeting and people are having to listen to two people
slug it out because their egos are all invested and now they have a
fucking audience including their manager. Bottom line, many things about
enterprise work are just bullshit. I hate that I have to play this game
again, or even observe and listen to it, but it's the job and people
have to get used to it. But please, leave your ego at the door and just
own when you don't understand or don't have experience with something.
Otherwise, it never ends well.
