# Moods, Modes, and States of Being

These will change over time. But hopefully this will help people keep up
with what's going on with <http://rwxrob.tv>.

🔴 **Live** I'm streaming, specifically that OBS is running on my
machine at the moment.

🕹️  **Gaming** I'm playing a video game of some kind, usually
Dota2, TF2, Minecraft, or ShenzenIO. 

💬 **Chatting** I'm actively chatting with people from the chat
room(s) including Twitch and YouTube (and eventually Matrix and IRC).

☕ **Focusing** I'm ignoring pretty much everything but my screen and
coffee in order to focus in flow state.

💰 **Working** I'm off screen a lot doing other stuff to make money for
a living, the "day job" if you prefer. I'll sometimes come on screen to
chat or search or take notes about something. 

🤬 **Ranting** I'm pissed off and using the word "fuck" a lot.

🔇 **Muted** There is no sound whatsoever coming from my stream (for
better or worse). Keep in mind I might be totally jamming out or
watching videos but you'll never hear them when I'm muted. This is the
normal mode for this live stream when Working, Focusing, and Away.

🎉 **Partying** Usually this means I have music on and am just
celebrating and being happy with y'all.

🐟 **Away** The fishies screensaver is on and I'm no where near the
computer (usually). This is not the same as stepping away for a few
minutes to take a break like I do with other modes. It means I likely
won't be back for a long time. Don't wait around.

🎬 **Recording** I'm recording what is happening on the screen to be
placed into a video saved forever on YouTube. Be careful what you chat.
Use the octothorpe (`#`) if you don't want your chat readable on screen.
