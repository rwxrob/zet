# I Prefer Twitch Format Over YouTube

I've concluded that I will be posting very little to YouTube from now on
and adding this disclaimer below to every playlist. Engaging with the
Twitch and Discord community in real time is far more valuable than
dealing with these kind of comments in YouTube where you can't even
engage in any meaningful way.

Here's a comment on YouTube videos (exported from Twitch) that conveys
the frustration YouTube viewers have with the Twitch format:

> Annoying twitch chatters, i feel like you get really distracted by
> them.

I had to add the following warning:

> [WARNING: THESE ARE NOT YOUTUBE VIDEOS! They are co-learning sessions
> with friends on Twitch that happen to be saved to YouTube. They are
> distracted, long, and annoying to most YouTube viewers. You have been
> warned. Watch something else if that bothers you.]

I've learned a lot from streaming over the last two years and perhaps
the biggest conclusion is that *Twitch is NOT YouTube*. Even the YouTube
vloggers edit their videos. I don't and never will. People on Twitch
expect that. They are used to watching gamers and IRL streamers meander
about all sorts of different things on their streams. YouTube viewers
expect hyper-polished beautiful, consumable lessons with a script, or
summations. Hell, even the adventure cycling videos are radically edited
compared to just watching someone bike around from their shoulder and
talking to them in real time about it.

In other words, the "distracting chatters" are the whole fucking point
of Twitch and many on Twitch could do well to remember that ---
especially if the goal is co-learning and education.
