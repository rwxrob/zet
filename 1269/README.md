# Trevor Slocum, Creator of `cview` (`tview` Fork)

I have to say I'm a big fan of Trevor's from afar. He too the things
about `tview` that he didn't like, forked it, and then sought out the
best place to host it all. At first he was on Source Hut, in fact,
that's how I found out about it. Then he moved to GitLab and his
decision to do that triggered a renewed in GitLab that ended with me
migrating everything over to GitLab. About a year later I realized
GitHub was destroying GitLab on all fronts --- particularly support for
FOSS by promoting sponsorships --- and I moved. Now, it seems, the
`cview` project has also moved, to <https://rocketnine.space>, which
turns out to be Gitea running on Trevor's own hosting service.  I think
that is brilliant. I've wanted to do that ever since GitHub pulled my
educator status and gave me 30 days to get all my SkilStak stuff off or
pay them for a professional org account. I've been conflicted, for
obvious reasons, and (for the moment) am really centralizing on GitHub,
but once again, Trevor has indirectly inspired me to take a look at dual
committing to a Gitea as well so that in the event that GitHub does
something stupid and sudden again I have someplace to send my users.
