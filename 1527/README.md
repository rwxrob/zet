# How to Know Twitch User Has Blocked You

You can block a user, or you can *be* blocked. Both have the same
effect.

> Blocking a user will:
>
> * Prevent them from sending you whispers
> * Prevent them from hosting you
> * Prevent them from adding you as a friend
> * Prevent them from purchasing gift subs for other users in your channel
> * Filter their messages out of chats you donâ€™t moderate

The other day I was enjoying watching a nice streamer and chatting with
friends in their stream when I noticed that there was a lot of chat
showing on the screen (because of the Stream Elements plugin) that I was
not seeing in Twitch chat. In that moment, I realized that the only
explanation was that the person had blocked me (or that I had blocked
them). I confirmed by checking my list of blocked people and seeing that
they were not in the list. The only remaining conclusion is that they
chose to ban me.
