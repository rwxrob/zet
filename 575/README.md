# Slack Got Better

Been almost eight years since I used Slack regularly and I have to say
I'm impressed with several of the changes that bring it up to par with
Discord for some things and better in others.

* **Slack has threads off of any message.** This creates amazing
  opportunities for side conversations that do not impact the main
  thread. I cannot overstate how much I wish Discord did this. In fact,
  this is such an important thing that I would consider switching
  everything to Slack just for this reason alone.

* **Slack still has a better integration API.** I've only casually
  looked at it, but so many enterprises are integrating plugins for
  different things Slack has them all using a command-line interface
  without a terminal and not even realizing it.

* **Slack formatting is still horrible.** The single star around
  something is still bold (even though that is against Markdown). And
  there is still no language detection at all with the triple backtick.
  I swear, if I get another three pages of unreadable code in a Slack
  message instead of a Gist or link to *anything* else Imma go postal on
  someone.
