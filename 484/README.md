ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/EYIbB1t1ZWs>

* Introduced to Yoga from P90X in about 2008 (before divorce)
* Liked the physical and mental focus
* Didn't do much with it until after divorce
* Got divorced, left Mormon church, looking for something spiritual
* Started a paddle board meetup and during one session saw yoga dude
* During SUP meeting topic of yoga on paddle came up 
* Took a Yoga at Gold's gym to do "research" and got hooked
* Obsessively researched all forms of Yoga, settled on Ashtanga
* Daily Ashtanga became integral part of my life
* Met Doris and decided to ask her to marry me at yoga rave
* Doris and I both completed Yoga training at Asheville Yoga Center
* Went on to help young people from SKILSTAK learn it
* Gave up for a few years, but have returned to regular practice
* Yoga is about finding your own personal practice
