# Goodbye YouTube Live Streaming

YouTube has screwed me over again. For the third time YouTube decided to
start live streaming even though I never started a stream from their
dashboard. For more than three months I have been sending stream data to
their servers but protected from having it become live by not
explicitly starting a stream, but sometime in the last month that
stopped being true and suddenly my streams containing a few songs that
are more sensitive than others with regard to copyright started tripping
their copyright strike things. YouTube did grant my first appeal, but
after that no more. So now I have a "Warning" which is the first step
before a "Strike" that is not at all my fault. YouTube chose to start a
live stream without my authorization.

I had to disable live chat earlier because they cannot secure that
either. It was full of harassment that could not be removed. So there's
another reason.

As of this moment, I am not planning on ever live streaming to YouTube
again. You would think a company of that size and technical prowess
would not make dumb-ass mistakes like this. But I've come to learn that
the companies that are the best funded are never necessarily the best.
They were just chosen by the VC capitalist gods to win while their
better competitors are snuffed out. Those are the rules of the game.
