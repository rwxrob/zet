# Creativity is Beaten Out of Us

Sir Ken Robinson suggests that our natural creative impulses and habits
are "beaten out of us" from a very early age. Children are naturally
inquisitive. They produce their own learning environments. Their play is
no less than them creating labs and learning through exploration,
experimentation, and imagination. And yet *most* adults stop doing these
things. "Playing around" with things is somehow looked down upon.
